      "I need to find my niche as an artist. Could you help create a summary of the text below? \n\n\"How to find your art niche: The ultimate guide\nTHE 5 ELEMENTS OF A SUCCESSFUL ART NICHE\nWhat helped me find my niche was realizing that you can break art niches into 5 elements: Theme, Subject Matter, Style, Medium and Use:\nA theme is the main idea or message behind your artwork. This could be dear to you, like empowering women and helping them to feel confident and beautiful. But it doesn't have to be a global issue unless you want it to be, it could be as simple as celebrating nature or making people laugh, and your theme can be as loud or subtle as you want it to be.\nThe subject matter is the \"subjects\" or \"things\" you paint, draw, or photograph. The subjects could be landscapes, seascapes, animals, portraits, food, elves, ballerina frogs, goth dolls, or anything your heart desires. Again, the sky's the limit here, so try not to get too caught up in this one. Think about what you would love to draw over and over. \nUsually, when we think of style, we think about how you execute your artwork. This is the technical stuff like shape language, color palette, and composition. Although when we talk about finding your art niche style, we can think of style as a \"label\" or name that your audience will recognise the style as.\nSome labels or \"styles\" examples are realism, abstract, anime, contemporary, boho, etc. These are just some examples, and your style can be a combination of many different ones or something entirely new that you create yourself. A broad label is important because it will help you find your people and help them find you.\nMEDIUM:\nMedium is the actual tools or materials you use to create your artwork. For example, my medium is usually digital, but I also use watercolor, and ink. Yours could be anything you love making art with, from oil paint to digital. The medium element of your niche is the most flexible one, so don't feel like you have to stick to just one.\nUSE:\nThe Use Element is how customers will use your artwork once it's complete. For example, my art is sold on home décor, apparel, and wall art among other things.  \nNow that we know the different elements of an art niche, let's talk about how to find yours. There are endless possibilities when it comes to finding your art niche, but I'm going to share my process with you so that you can have a framework to start with. These steps are inspired by the Japanese concept of Ikigai, which is often translated to \"life's purpose\". The goal here is to find something you love doing, you can stick to and that people will actually pay you for. So, grab your journal and brainstorm with me!\nWhat do you love? This question is where you get to think about what themes, styles and subject matter you are most drawn to. Your answers to this question will be the foundation of your niche. Look at your current work and see if there is a common thread. If not, that's okay! You can try out different things until you find what feels right for you.\nFor example, I love painting and drawing portraits, animals, and botanicals. I am also drawn to themes of freedom, dark fantasy, mythology, mental health awareness, concept art, animation, heritage patterns and nature. These are a lot and all over the place, which is normal. Don't worry if you are listing a lot of different things here. We will narrow it down in the next step.\nNow it's time to take the list of things you love and narrow it down. The goal here is to find something you are passionate about and good at OR something you are passionate about and willing to put in the work to get good at. You don't need to be the best at something to make a living from it, but you do need to be good enough that people are willing to pay you for your work.\nThink about what mediums and subject matter you are good at (or better at). This step is when we have to start to be more selective and give ourselves honest feedback. For example, you might love to paint both human and animal portraits, but your animal paintings always get more attention. Perhaps your linework is stronger than your painting skills, or you enjoy digital art, but your traditional work gets more compliments and requests. This step will require a lot of honest self-reflection, and it's okay if you need some time to sit with this question. It's also okay if your list here is shorter than your first one. The goal is not to have a long list but a focused one. If you are just starting out, it's likely that you haven't found your artistic voice or medium yet. And that's okay! Keep exploring and trying new things until you find a combination that works for you. Finding your niche is quite an advanced step in your artistic journey, so be kind to yourself and take all the time you need.\nWHAT DOES THE WORLD NEED? (USE, STYLE)\nIn this step, you think about how your artwork can be of service to others. How can it make someone's life better? This is a great question to ask if you are struggling to come up with ideas for your niche. Now is also the time to think about the final product you want to create.\n•\tWhat kind of product do you want to make, and who would buy it?\n•\tWhat words would they use to search for it?\n•\tPut yourself into your client's shoes; what do they need/want?\nWHAT CAN YOU GET PAID FOR? (THEME, SUBJECT MATTER, MEDIUM)\nThis step is all about thinking practically. What are people willing to pay you for? This step will help you focus on your niche even more and ensure it is profitable. By now, you should have a big list of things you love and are good at, but not all of them will be things people are willing to invest in.\nFor example, I love painting portraits but not as many people are willing to buy them. On the other hand, I get a lot of requests for animal art and custom patterns which people are happy to pay for. This result is my personal experience tho, and yours may be different! You will need to do some research to figure out what people in your target market are looking for and what they are willing to invest in.\nSome things to consider once you narrow down your choices: \n•\tWhat type of product will this artwork apply to?\n•\tCan you find any examples of people selling similar work?\n•\tAre there enough people interested in this type of product?\n•\tWhat is the best way to sell this work? (Licensing, limited editions, stickers etc.)\n•\tWhat is the going rate for this kind of artwork?\nNow it's time to put it all together and come up with your final niche! Your niche should be a combination of what you love, what you're good at, what the world needs, and what people are willing to pay for.\nFor example, a niche description could be: \n•\tpainting cute animals and plants in a modern style to license for children's home décor and apparel brands.\n•\tdrawing black and white cityscapes with a focus on architecture to sell as prints and postcards to tourists.\n•\tInspiring calligraphy and hand-lettering artwork to sell on posters to college students who are into self-care and are looking for wall decor for their dorm rooms.\nGet specific and make sure your niche is focused but also broad enough that you have room to grow. Remember, this can always be tweaked and changed as you go along. And if you get really stuck, don't hesitate to reach out for help.\n\"",
      "This guide offers insights on finding an art niche. A successful art niche consists of five elements:\n1. **Theme**: The main idea or message behind the artwork, which can range from global issues to simple joys.\n2. **Subject Matter**: The things an artist paints, draws, or photographs, with endless possibilities.\n3. **Style**: How the artwork is executed, or a recognizable \"label\" for the audience, which can be a combination or new creation.\n4. **Medium**: The tools or materials used to create art, and it's flexible to use multiple.\n5. **Use**: How customers will use the completed artwork.\n\nTo find your art niche:\n1. **Identify What You Love**: Look at current work for common threads, or try different themes, styles, and subject - matter until something feels right.\n2. **Narrow It Down**: Select what you're passionate about and good at, or willing to work on to get good at. Be honest with self - reflection on mediums and subject matter.\n3. **Consider What the World Needs**: Think about how your art can serve others and what kind of product clients would want and search for.\n4. **Determine What You Can Get Paid For**: Do research to find out what people in your target market are willing to invest in. Consider product types, similar sellers, interest levels, selling methods, and pricing.\n\nFinally, combine these aspects to create a focused yet growth - friendly niche description. The niche can be adjusted over time, and seeking help is an option if stuck. ",
      "Help me brainstorm a couple of ideas for my artistic niche. I mostly create animals and landscapes, with a focus on North America. I create with watercolor or digital. The part I need help brainstorming is the \"Considered what the world needs: and the \"Determine what you can get paid for\" parts. Can you help me come up with 3 ideas for each?",
      "### Considered what the world needs\n#### 1. Environmental Awareness Art\nThe world is facing numerous environmental challenges, and there's a growing need to raise awareness about North American ecosystems. You could create watercolor or digital paintings of endangered North American animals in their natural landscapes. For example, painting the California condor soaring over the Grand Canyon. They can help people connect emotionally with these species and understand the importance of protecting their habitats.\n\n#### 2. Mental Health and Nature Therapy Art\nIn today's fast - paced and often stressful world, people are increasingly turning to nature for mental health benefits. Your North American animal and landscape art can serve as a form of nature therapy. Create serene digital or watercolor scenes like a moose standing by a peaceful Canadian lake at dawn or a bison grazing on the prairies of the American Midwest. \n\n#### 3. Cultural Heritage Preservation Art\nNorth America has a rich and diverse cultural heritage, often intertwined with its landscapes and native animals. You could focus on depicting the relationship between indigenous cultures and the North American wildlife and landscapes. This art can help preserve and celebrate these cultural legacies.\n\n### Determine what you can get paid for\n#### 1. Home Decor Prints\nPeople love to decorate their homes with beautiful art. You can create high - quality watercolor or digital prints of your North American animal and landscape art. Offer different sizes and framing options. For example, a large print of a grizzly bear in the Rocky Mountains could be a statement piece for a living room, while smaller prints of hummingbirds in a garden could be used in a or hallway. You can sell these prints through online marketplaces like Etsy, at local art fairs, or even partner with home decor stores.\n\n#### 2. Licensing for Stationery and Gifts\nThere is a huge market for stationery and gift items with unique art designs. You can license your North American - themed art to companies that produce items like greeting cards, notebooks, coasters, and mugs. For instance, a set of greeting cards featuring different North American birds or a notebook with a cover design of a New England lighthouse landscape. This way, your art can reach a wider audience, and you can earn royalties from each sale.\n\n#### 3. Custom Pet Portraits in North American Landscapes\nMany pet owners are willing to pay for custom portraits of their beloved animals. You can combine your love for animals and North American landscapes by creating custom pet portraits set against North American backdrops. For example, if a customer has a Labrador retriever, you could paint it running through a field of wildflowers in the Canadian Rockies. ",

I just want to know the most important parts.\n\nThe worsening security situation in south County Armagh, especially after the killing of three British soldiers at an observation post in November 1975 and the massacre of ten Protestant workers in January 1976, prompted British PM Harold Wilson to publicly acknowledge the presence of D squadron of the Special Air Service (SAS), which was deployed to Bessbrook Mill. The ambush of the observation post exposed the fact that conventional military tactics hadn't worked for the British Government in South Armagh, since the British Army report of this incident identified a number of basic mistakes regarding camouflage, routine patterns and the observation post's arrangement.\n\nOn 28 October 1971, a confrontation had taken place between British and Irish troops at a cross-border bridge between the Republic and Northern Ireland, at the village of Munnelly, between counties Fermanagh and Monaghan. A British patrol was laying explosive charges to destroy the bridge, as part of an effort to destroy bridges and roads being used by the Provisional IRA to import arms and supplies from the Republic of Ireland into Northern Ireland. A Garda Síochána officer stated that the bridge was at least half in the Republic, and the British Army officer on the scene disputed this. The Irish Army then deployed a unit of soldiers and its commander, armed with a submachine gun, demanded that the British Army surrender their explosives. Following a 90-minute standoff, the British Army withdrew."

      "I need to find my niche as an artist. Could you help create a summary of the text below? \n\n\"How to find your art niche: The ultimate guide\nTHE 5 ELEMENTS OF A SUCCESSFUL ART NICHE\nWhat helped me find my niche was realizing that you can break art niches into 5 elements: Theme, Subject Matter, Style, Medium and Use:\nA theme is the main idea or message behind your artwork. This could be dear to you, like empowering women and helping them to feel confident and beautiful. But it doesn't have to be a global issue unless you want it to be, it could be as simple as celebrating nature or making people laugh, and your theme can be as loud or subtle as you want it to be.\nThe subject matter is the \"subjects\" or \"things\" you paint, draw, or photograph. The subjects could be landscapes, seascapes, animals, portraits, food, elves, ballerina frogs, goth dolls, or anything your heart desires. Again, the sky's the limit here, so try not to get too caught up in this one. Think about what you would love to draw over and over. \nUsually, when we think of style, we think about how you execute your artwork. This is the technical stuff like shape language, color palette, and composition. Although when we talk about finding your art niche style, we can think of style as a \"label\" or name that your audience will recognise the style as.\nSome labels or \"styles\" examples are realism, abstract, anime, contemporary, boho, etc. These are just some examples, and your style can be a combination of many different ones or something entirely new that you create yourself. A broad label is important because it will help you find your people and help them find you.\nMEDIUM:\nMedium is the actual tools or materials you use to create your artwork. For example, my medium is usually digital, but I also use watercolor, and ink. Yours could be anything you love making art with, from oil paint to digital. The medium element of your niche is the most flexible one, so don't feel like you have to stick to just one.\nUSE:\nThe Use Element is how customers will use your artwork once it's complete. For example, my art is sold on home décor, apparel, and wall art among other things.  \nNow that we know the different elements of an art niche, let's talk about how to find yours. There are endless possibilities when it comes to finding your art niche, but I'm going to share my process with you so that you can have a framework to start with. These steps are inspired by the Japanese concept of Ikigai, which is often translated to \"life's purpose\". The goal here is to find something you love doing, you can stick to and that people will actually pay you for. So, grab your journal and brainstorm with me!\nWhat do you love? This question is where you get to think about what themes, styles and subject matter you are most drawn to. Your answers to this question will be the foundation of your niche. Look at your current work and see if there is a common thread. If not, that's okay! You can try out different things until you find what feels right for you.\nFor example, I love painting and drawing portraits, animals, and botanicals. I am also drawn to themes of freedom, dark fantasy, mythology, mental health awareness, concept art, animation, heritage patterns and nature. These are a lot and all over the place, which is normal. Don't worry if you are listing a lot of different things here. We will narrow it down in the next step.\nNow it's time to take the list of things you love and narrow it down. The goal here is to find something you are passionate about and good at OR something you are passionate about and willing to put in the work to get good at. You don't need to be the best at something to make a living from it, but you do need to be good enough that people are willing to pay you for your work.\nThink about what mediums and subject matter you are good at (or better at). This step is when we have to start to be more selective and give ourselves honest feedback. For example, you might love to paint both human and animal portraits, but your animal paintings always get more attention. Perhaps your linework is stronger than your painting skills, or you enjoy digital art, but your traditional work gets more compliments and requests. This step will require a lot of honest self-reflection, and it's okay if you need some time to sit with this question. It's also okay if your list here is shorter than your first one. The goal is not to have a long list but a focused one. If you are just starting out, it's likely that you haven't found your artistic voice or medium yet. And that's okay! Keep exploring and trying new things until you find a combination that works for you. Finding your niche is quite an advanced step in your artistic journey, so be kind to yourself and take all the time you need.\nWHAT DOES THE WORLD NEED? (USE, STYLE)\nIn this step, you think about how your artwork can be of service to others. How can it make someone's life better? This is a great question to ask if you are struggling to come up with ideas for your niche. Now is also the time to think about the final product you want to create.\n•\tWhat kind of product do you want to make, and who would buy it?\n•\tWhat words would they use to search for it?\n•\tPut yourself into your client's shoes; what do they need/want?\nWHAT CAN YOU GET PAID FOR? (THEME, SUBJECT MATTER, MEDIUM)\nThis step is all about thinking practically. What are people willing to pay you for? This step will help you focus on your niche even more and ensure it is profitable. By now, you should have a big list of things you love and are good at, but not all of them will be things people are willing to invest in.\nFor example, I love painting portraits but not as many people are willing to buy them. On the other hand, I get a lot of requests for animal art and custom patterns which people are happy to pay for. This result is my personal experience tho, and yours may be different! You will need to do some research to figure out what people in your target market are looking for and what they are willing to invest in.\nSome things to consider once you narrow down your choices: \n•\tWhat type of product will this artwork apply to?\n•\tCan you find any examples of people selling similar work?\n•\tAre there enough people interested in this type of product?\n•\tWhat is the best way to sell this work? (Licensing, limited editions, stickers etc.)\n•\tWhat is the going rate for this kind of artwork?\nNow it's time to put it all together and come up with your final niche! Your niche should be a combination of what you love, what you're good at, what the world needs, and what people are willing to pay for.\nFor example, a niche description could be: \n•\tpainting cute animals and plants in a modern style to license for children's home décor and apparel brands.\n•\tdrawing black and white cityscapes with a focus on architecture to sell as prints and postcards to tourists.\n•\tInspiring calligraphy and hand-lettering artwork to sell on posters to college students who are into self-care and are looking for wall decor for their dorm rooms.\nGet specific and make sure your niche is focused but also broad enough that you have room to grow. Remember, this can always be tweaked and changed as you go along. And if you get really stuck, don't hesitate to reach out for help.\n\""

The part I need help brainstorming is the \"Considered what the world needs: and the \"Determine what you can get paid for\" parts. Can you help me come up with 3 ideas for each?",
      "### Considered what the world needs\n#### 1. Environmental Awareness Art\nThe world is facing numerous environmental challenges, and there's a growing need to raise awareness about North American ecosystems. You could create watercolor or digital paintings of endangered North American animals in their natural landscapes. For example, painting the California condor soaring over the Grand Canyon. They can help people connect emotionally with these species and understand the importance of protecting their habitats.\n\n#### 2. Mental Health and Nature Therapy Art\nIn today's fast - paced and often stressful world, people are increasingly turning to nature for mental health benefits. Your North American animal and landscape art can serve as a form of nature therapy. Create serene digital or watercolor scenes like a moose standing by a peaceful Canadian lake at dawn or a bison grazing on the prairies of the American Midwest. \n\n#### 3. Cultural Heritage Preservation Art\nNorth America has a rich and diverse cultural heritage, often intertwined with its landscapes and native animals. You could focus on depicting the relationship between indigenous cultures and the North American wildlife and landscapes. This art can help preserve and celebrate these cultural legacies.\n\n### Determine what you can get paid for\n#### 1. Home Decor Prints\nPeople love to decorate their homes with beautiful art. You can create high - quality watercolor or digital prints of your North American animal and landscape art. Offer different sizes and framing options. For example, a large print of a grizzly bear in the Rocky Mountains could be a statement piece for a living room, while smaller prints of hummingbirds in a garden could be used in a or hallway. You can sell these prints through online marketplaces like Etsy, at local art fairs, or even partner with home decor stores.\n\n#### 2. Licensing for Stationery and Gifts\nThere is a huge market for stationery and gift items with unique art designs. You can license your North American - themed art to companies that produce items like greeting cards, notebooks, coasters, and mugs. For instance, a set of greeting cards featuring different North American birds or a notebook with a cover design of a New England lighthouse landscape. This way, your art can reach a wider audience, and you can earn royalties from each sale.\n\n#### 3. Custom Pet Portraits in North American Landscapes\nMany pet owners are willing to pay for custom portraits of their beloved animals. You can combine your love for animals and North American landscapes by creating custom pet portraits set against North American backdrops. For example, if a customer has a Labrador retriever, you could paint it running through a field of wildflowers in the Canadian Rockies. ",

      "### Step - by - Step Guide to Getting Your Educational Art into Nature Centers and National Park Visitor Center Stores\n\n#### 1. Define Your Artistic Niche for Education\n- **Tailor Your Content**: Based on your skills in drawing plants, animals, and landscapes, focus on creating art that serves an educational purpose. For example, illustrate the life cycle of a particular North American species, or show the different layers of a forest ecosystem.\n- **Target Audience**: Determine who your art is aimed at. For nature centers, it could be families with children, school groups, or curious adults. For home - schoolers, you might create more structured lesson - based art, like worksheets with illustrations.\n\n#### 2. Research Potential Nature Centers and National Parks\n- **Local Nature Centers**: Start with nearby nature centers. Look at their mission statements, educational programs, and existing merchandise. This will help you understand if your art aligns with their values and what they already offer.\n- **National Parks**: Research the visitor center stores of national parks you're interested in. Note down any themes or types of educational art they currently sell, and identify gaps that your work could fill.\n\n#### 3. Develop a Professional Portfolio\n- **High - Quality Images**: Take clear, high - resolution photos or scans of your artwork. Use proper lighting and a clean background to showcase your pieces at their best.\n- **Organization**: Organize your portfolio by theme, such as plant illustrations, animal portraits, or landscape series. Include a brief description of each piece, highlighting its educational value.\n- **Online Presence**: Create an online portfolio on a platform like Behance, Dribbble, or your own website. This makes it easy for potential clients to view your work and contact you.\n\n#### 4. Create Educational Materials to Accompany Your Art\n- **Fact Sheets**: For each piece of art, develop fact sheets that provide detailed information about the plants, animals, or landscapes depicted. Include scientific names, interesting facts, and conservation status.\n- **Lesson Plans**: If targeting home - schoolers or nature center educational programs, create lesson plans that incorporate your art. For example, a lesson on forest ecosystems could use your landscape illustration as a visual aid.\n\n#### 5. Price Your Artwork Appropriately\n- **Cost Analysis**: Consider the time, materials, and effort you put into creating each piece. Factor in the cost of printing, framing (if applicable), and any associated educational materials.\n- **Market Research**: Look at the prices of similar educational art in nature center stores and online.

Persistence can be key in getting noticed.\n\n#### 7. Prepare for Meetings or Presentations\n- **Pitch Deck**: Create a pitch deck that highlights your artistic style, the educational value of your work, and how it fits into the nature center or national park's mission. Include examples of your art, testimonials (if you have any), and pricing information.\n- **Practice Your Pitch**: Rehearse your presentation to ensure you can clearly and confidently communicate the benefits of your art. Anticipate questions and prepare thoughtful answers.\n\n#### 8. Negotiate Terms and Contracts\n- **Licensing and Sales**: Discuss with the nature center or national park how your art will be sold or licensed. Determine if they will take a percentage of sales, and clarify the terms of any exclusivity agreements.\n- **Copyright and Usage Rights**: Make sure you understand and protect your copyright. Clearly define how your art can be used, reproduced, and displayed.\n- **Payment Terms**: Agree on payment schedules, such as when you will receive payment for sold artwork or royalties.\n\n#### 9. Produce and Deliver Your Artwork\n- **Printing and Packaging**: If your art will be sold as prints, ensure high - quality printing and professional packaging. Consider using eco - friendly materials if possible.\n- **Timely Delivery**: Meet the agreed - upon deadlines for delivering your artwork to the nature center or national park visitor center store. This builds trust and a good reputation.\n\n#### 10. Evaluate and Adapt\n- **Feedback Collection**: Regularly ask for feedback from the nature center staff, visitors, and home - schoolers who purchase your art. Use this feedback to improve your work and educational materials.\n- **Market Trends**: Stay updated on educational art trends and changes in the nature center and national park retail markets. Adapt your art and marketing strategies accordingly to continue growing your presence.\n\n### Logistics to Consider\n- **Shipping and Storage**: If you're delivering your art to multiple locations, you'll need to consider shipping costs and methods. Also, think about where you'll store your artwork before it's sold.\n- **Inventory Management**: Keep track of your inventory to ensure you have enough pieces in stock, especially during peak tourist seasons.\n- **Taxes and Legal Requirements**: Understand the tax implications of selling your art, and make sure you comply with all relevant legal requirements, such as business licenses and sales tax collection.",

Its two sieges, especially that of 1758, were turning points in the Anglo-French struggle for what today is Canada.\n\nThe original settlement was founded in 1713 by settlers from Terre-Neuve, and initially called Havre à l'Anglois. Subsequently, the fishing port grew to become a major commercial port and a strongly defended fortress. The fortifications eventually surrounded the town. The walls were constructed mainly between 1720 and 1740. By the mid-1740s Louisbourg, named for Louis XIV of France, was one of the most extensive European fortifications constructed in North America.\n\nThe site was supported by two smaller garrisons on Île Royale located at present-day St. Peter's and Englishtown. The Fortress of Louisbourg suffered key weaknesses, since it was erected on low-lying ground commanded by nearby hills and its design was directed mainly toward sea-based assaults, leaving the land-facing defences relatively weak. A third weakness was that it was a long way from France or Quebec, from which reinforcements might be sent. It was captured by British colonists in 1745, and was a major bargaining chip in the negotiations leading to the 1748 treaty ending the War of the Austrian Succession. It was returned to the French in exchange for border towns in what is today Belgium.

      "Create a bulleted summary for these best practices for teaching Kindergarten.\n\nHow To Teach Kindergarten Kids:  Best Tips\n\n1. Creating a Welcoming Environment\nThe first step in teaching kindergarten effectively is to create a welcoming environment. A warm and inclusive classroom sets the tone for a positive learning experience. It’s essential for young learners to feel safe, valued, and eager to explore. This atmosphere encourages them to express themselves and engage actively in learning.\n\nIdeas for Classroom Setup and Decoration:\n\nWhen considering kindergarten teaching ideas for classroom setup, think about vibrant, stimulating, yet organized spaces. Use colorful decorations, educational posters, and designated areas for different activities. Ensure the classroom layout is accessible and comfortable for all children, reflecting a diverse and inclusive atmosphere.\n\nRelated Reading: Best Tips For a Student-Centered Learning Environment\n2. Establishing Routines and Expectations\nConsistency is key in how to teach kindergarten. Establishing clear routines and expectations helps children feel secure and understand what is expected of them. This structure aids in managing the classroom and enhances the children’s ability to focus and learn.\n\nExamples of Effective Routines and Rules:\n\nEffective tips for teaching kindergarten include establishing a daily schedule with visual timelines, setting simple rules that are easy to understand and follow, and incorporating routine activities like morning circles or Storytime. These routines help in creating a disciplined yet nurturing environment.\n\n3. Incorporating Play-Based Learning\nPlay-based learning is a cornerstone of kindergarten education. It allows children to explore, discover, and learn in a natural and enjoyable way. Through play, children develop critical thinking, creativity, and social skills, making it a powerful tool in the kindergarten teacher’s arsenal.\n\nSuggestions for Play-Based Activities:\n\nNature Scavenger Hunt: Organize a scavenger hunt in a safe outdoor area like a schoolyard or a park. Prepare a list of natural items for children to find, such as a leaf, a smooth stone, a feather, etc. This activity encourages exploration, observation skills, and a love for nature. It also provides a great opportunity for physical activity and learning about the environment.\n\nDIY Craft Station: Set up a craft station with materials like colored paper, glue, scissors, markers, and recyclable materials (like cardboard tubes, bottle caps, etc.). Encourage children to create art projects or provide a theme for them to work on. \n\nAlongside these offline activities, consider incorporating educational online games as well, as they offer a diverse range of learning experiences and allow for easy tracking and assessment of a child’s progress in various skills. \n4. Developing Fine and Gross Motor Skills\nPhysical development, including fine and gross motor skills, is integral to kindergarten instructional strategies. Developing these skills is essential for children’s overall growth and aids in writing, cutting, and sports activities.\n\nIdeas for Activities that Enhance Motor Skills:\n\nOnline games are an excellent tool for enhancing fine motor skills in kindergartners. These interactive games help improve hand-eye coordination and precision as children navigate coloring within lines. Such games make learning fun and significantly contribute to a child’s developmental milestones in motor skills.\n\n5. Fostering Social and Emotional Development\nOne of the key teaching strategies for kindergarten is to foster social and emotional development. Teaching empathy, sharing, and cooperation is vital in shaping well-rounded individuals. Encourage activities that require teamwork, and use storytime to discuss themes of empathy and kindness. Role-playing games can also effectively teach children to understand and respect the feelings of others.\n\nActivities that Promote Social Skills:\n\nGroup activities are excellent for promoting social skills. Organize games and projects that require collaboration, allowing children to practice communication, turn-taking, and conflict resolution. These experiences are crucial in building a supportive and interactive classroom community.\n\n6. Encouraging Creative Expression\nCreative expression through art, music, and drama is essential in kindergarten education. These activities provide a medium for self-expression and emotional exploration and aid in developing fine motor skills, cognitive abilities, and social skills.\n\n"

      "Please summarize the following article in one paragraph.\n_____________________________________\n\nThis Type of Coffee Is the Worst for Heart Health, According to Cardiologists\nEmily Laurence\n\nIf you’re one of the 66% of Americans who drinks coffee, you likely can’t imagine starting your day without it. For many, having a cup of coffee is so ingrained into their morning routine that they have an automatic coffee maker that is pre-scheduled to brew a pot so it’s ready to drink as soon as they wake up.\n\nConsidering that it’s daily rituals impact our health the most, it’s important to know how your coffee habit impacts your heart. According to cardiologists, it all depends on how you have it.\n\nIs Coffee Good for Heart Health?\n\nWhen it comes to how black coffee (with nothing in it) impacts heart health, scientific research is mixed. “There have been many studies looking at coffee, with mixed results. We do know that coffee can raise blood pressure and increase the stiffness of arteries, both of which are bad for your heart. However, one study found that drinking coffee in moderation could decrease the risk of high blood pressure, high cholesterol and other heart health risk factors, says Dr. Edo Paz, MD, MPH, a cardiologist and the Senior Vice President of Medical Affairs at Hello Heart.\n\nWith this conflicting data in mind, Dr. Paz says he recommends drinking coffee in moderation, capping it at one cup a day. Dr. Sam Setareh, MD, MS, FACC, the Director of Clinical Cardiology and Cardiovascular Performance at Beverly Hills Cardiovascular, also recommends drinking black coffee in moderation.\n\n“Studies suggest that one to two cups of black coffee daily can improve cardiovascular health by lowering the risk of heart failure and promoting vascular function due to its antioxidant properties. However, excessive caffeine can increase heart rate and blood pressure, especially in sensitive individuals,” he says.\n\nThe Worst Type of Coffee for Heart Health\n\nWhile scientific studies do show that drinking black coffee in moderation can benefit cardiovascular health, both cardiologists say that how you prepare your coffee matters. Both doctors say that coffee drinks that contain sugar are absolutely not good for heart health.\n\n“Highly sweetened specialty drinks like caramel macchiatos or blended frappuccinos do more harm than good, when it comes to heart health. These beverages often contain hundreds of calories, large amounts of sugar and unhealthy fats, which can negate any potential heart-healthy benefits of coffee,” Dr. Setareh says.\n\nDr. Paz agrees, saying, “I would advise staying away from any coffee drinks that have high sugar content. Flavored coffees with lots of syrup would fall in this category and they are generally not heart-healthy.”\n\nTake a caramel macchiato for example. A grande Starbucks caramel macchiato has 33 grams of added sugar, which is more sugar than the American Heart Association recommends consuming in an entire day. By the way, it’s not just coffees you buy at cafes that can be high in sugar; Dr. Paz says that ready-to-drink coffee products can be high in sugar too.\n\nBoth doctors say that having a sugar-sweetened coffee every day can have detrimental health effects. “Added sugar has low nutritional value and can cause a lot of health problems. Too much sugar can damage blood vessels, lead to buildup of plaque inside the arteries and increase your risk of cardiac disease. It can also lead to other heart disease risk factors, like diabetes or high blood pressure,” Dr. Paz says.\n\nDr. Setareh says that the combination of sugar and caffeine in coffee drinks can be especially harmful. “Combining sugar with caffeine can create a stress response, spiking blood pressure and heart rate. Over time, these factors contribute to inflammation, plaque formation and an elevated risk of heart disease,” he says.\n\nHow To Make Your Coffee Habit More Heart Healthy-Friendly\n\nIf you prefer sugar-sweetened coffees to black coffee, Dr. Paz recommends making your coffee drink at home instead of buying a pre-made latte product or your coffee from a cafe. That way, you can control how much sugar or other ingredients, like creamer, you add. Instead of sugar, consider adding cinnamon to your coffee instead, which is beneficial for heart health.\n\n“If you enjoy coffee, opt for simpler preparations like black coffee or espresso, or add unsweetened plant-based milk,” Dr. Setareh says, offering his advice on how to keep your coffee habit heart-healthy.\n\nDr. Paz reiterates the importance of drinking coffee in moderation. Even if you like black coffee, drinking cup after cup of it all day can end up being detrimental to your health. “I enjoy a cup every morning to help me start my day and then I transition to water and other low-sugar, non-caffeinated drinks for the rest of the day. It’s all about keeping a balance,” he says.\n\n\nAs long as you keep these tips in mind, you can rest assured that when you have your morning cup of coffee, you are starting the day by doing something that benefits your heart instead of working against it. And that’s a pretty great way to start the day."

      "I want to impress my Korean girlfriend's mom, and I'm going over to her place to cook dinner tonight. Please summarize this Muguk recipe so I can prepare the soup from memory as if I make muguk all the time.\n\nEmail *\nSave Recipe\nTable of Contents\nKorean Radish Soup\nIngredients\nHow to cut Korean radish or daikon\nView All\nKorean Radish Soup\nKorean Radish Soup, or Mu (radish) Guk (soup), always reminds me of my mom and my childhood as she used to make this all the time for us.\n\nIt’s super popular in Korea because it’s easy to make and full of flavor, with tender radish slices, beef, and a little garlic kick. It’s perfect for those days when you want something cozy and satisfying without a lot of fuss.\n\nIf you haven’t tried this yet, trust me! Give it a go, and you’ll see why it’s a favorite in so many Korean homes!\n\nUnlike many Korean soups which tend to be pretty spicy or salty, muguk is mild flavored, making it a perfect dish to enjoy with your baby, toddler or older child.\n\nIngredients\nall the ingredients for the soup laid out on a large wooden board \nI am highlighting just the ones that need further explanation. The complete list is in the recipe card below.\n\nBeef – use any type of stewing meat, like brisket, chuck, or loin. You don’t want to use a fatty cut of meat otherwise the soup will be very oily.\nKorean radish – I purposefully used daikon when developing this recipe because it’s more readily available. It’s a good substitute, BUT if you are able to get your hands on Korean radish at an Asian grocery store, you’ll end up with a slightly sweeter, more flavorful soup. You can also make kimchi with it! Whether you’re using daikon or Korean radish, look for one that is firm and heavy.\nShiitake mushroom – This is not included in this classic version of the soup, but I like to add it for more flavor and depth.\nSoy sauce – Again, if you’re able to find it, the best choice is one specifically for soups – guk ganjang. It’s lighter in color (a distinctive feature of this dish) and less sweet. You can also control how much you want to use. See suggestions below.\nHow to cut Korean radish or daikon\na four image collage showing how to slice radish or daikon \nHere’s a super quick and easy way to cut it into uniform pieces. This is important for ensuring they all cook evenly.\n\nPeel the radish. Slice into 1 inch thick rounds\nAgain, slice into 1 inch pieces\nTurn the pieces so the slices are horizontal to you\nSlice into 1/4 inch thick pieces\nNow you have radish/daikon slices that are 1 inch squares and 1/4 inch thick.\n\nStep-by-Step Instructions\nBeef cooked in sesame oil in a pot. \nStep 1: Heat sesame oil in a pot over medium heat. Add beef and cook until about 70% cooked.\n\nBeef and radish in pot. \nStep 2: Add radish and stir for about 2-3 minutes.\n\nBeef and radish boiling in water. \nStep 3: Add garlic. Then add water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and cook for about 15-20 minutes. Using a small fine mesh strainer, skim off the foam floating on top.\n\nKorean radish soup all cooked with green onions in a pot. \nStep 4: Add mushrooms and green onion and cook for another 5-7 minutes. Set aside portion for baby and add soy sauce You can add more to taste, if you wish.\n\nVegetarian Korean Radish Soup\nInstead of meat, add 2 squares of dried kelp for more depth and that umami flavor. Cook radish in sesame oil for 1-2 minutes and in step 3, add the kelp to water along with garlic. After 10 minutes, remove the kelp and proceed with the rest of the instructions.\n\nRecipe Tip\nMake this soup the day before! Trust me on this. It will taste SO much better, especially since this is a baby-friendly version with minimal soy sauce.\n\nHow to serve to baby\nsoup in a baby's pink bowl with finely chopped beef, radish, and rice with just enough liquid to coat everything \nFinely chop the beef and mushrooms. You can serve the radish as is as it will be perfectly soft. Start with a small portion of rice or other grain/legume of choice (can always serve more) and pour just enough of the liquid to coat everything.\n\nAssemble 10 minutes or so prior to serving so the grains have a chance to soak up the liquid. They will also get softer and more flavorful.\n\nI know so many people avoid offering thin soups to their babies because of the incredible mess that ensues. This is definitely the secret to minimizing the havoc, especially during the first months of starting solids.\n\nAnd if you’re looking for a toxin-free, easy to clean bowl with the most powerful suction, I highly recommend this one! We’ve been using their plate and bowl since day 1, and they’re simply the best.\n\nMore Korean Recipes\nfinished baby friendly Korean bulgogi in a large skillet with an orange spatula\nBaby-Friendly Korean Bulgogi\nCooked pancake slices on a white platter with dipping sauce.\nKorean Vegetable Pancakes (Yachaejeon)\ncooked chicken, carrots, potatoes with green onion inside an instant pot\nInstant Pot Korean Chicken and Potatoes\nAn overhead shot of the different jumeokbap variations with toddler's hand grabbing one.\nJumeokbap (Korean Rice Balls)\nDid you make this recipe?

      "Summarize each of these character profiles.\n\nLink\nThe central protagonist of The Legend of Zelda series, Link is the name of various young male Hylians who characteristically wear a green tunic and a pointed cap, and are the bearers of the Triforce of Courage. In most games, the player can give Link a different name before the start of the adventure, and he will be referred by that given name throughout by the non-player characters (NPCs). Miyamoto said in a 2002 interview that he named the protagonist \"Link\" because the character is/was supposed to be the \"link\" between the player and the game world. The various Links each have a special title, such as \"Hero of Time\", \"Hero of Winds\" or \"Hero of the Wild\". Like many silent protagonists in video games, Link does not speak, only producing grunts, yells, etc., but he is not mute - dialogue from him is referenced second-hand by in-game characters, despite not being seen or heard by the player. Link is depicted as a silent protagonist so that the audience is able to have their own thoughts as to how their Link would answer the characters instead of him having scripted responses.\n\nPrincess Zelda\nPrincess Zelda is the princess of Hyrule and the guardian of the Triforce of Wisdom. Her name is present in many of her female ancestors and descendants. While most games require Link to save Zelda from Ganon, she sometimes plays a supporting role in battle, using magical powers and weapons such as Light Arrows to aid Link. With the exception of the CD-i games, she was not playable in the main series until Spirit Tracks, where she becomes a spirit and can possess a Phantom Knight that can be controlled by the player. Zelda appears under various other aliases and alter egos, including Sheik (in Ocarina of Time) and Tetra (in The Wind Waker and Phantom Hourglass). In Skyward Sword, it is revealed that the Zelda of that game is a reincarnation of the goddess Hylia, whose power flows through the royal bloodline. The name \"Zelda\" derives from the American novelist Zelda Fitzgerald.[74]\n\nGanon\nGanon, also known as Ganondorf in his humanoid form, is the main antagonist and the final boss in the majority of The Legend of Zelda games. In the series, Ganondorf is the leader of a race of desert brigands called the Gerudo, which consists entirely of female warriors save for one man born every one hundred years. He is significantly taller than other human NPCs, but his looks vary between games, often taking the form of a monstrous anthropomorphic boar. His specific motives vary from game to game, but most often his plans include him kidnapping Princess Zelda and planning to achieve domination of Hyrule and presumably the world beyond it. To this end, he seeks the Triforce, a powerful magical relic. He often possesses a portion of the Triforce called the Triforce of Power, which gives him great strength, but it is often not enough to accomplish his ends, leading him to hunt the remaining Triforce pieces. Unlike Link, Zelda, and most other recurring characters, he is actually the same person in every game, with the exception of Four Swords Adventures, where he is a reincarnation of the original. In each game the battles with him are different and he fights using different styles. The game Skyward Sword indicates that Ganon is a reincarnation of an evil deity known as Demise."

      "Can you summarize this text for me?\n\nA Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy (1768) is a novel by Laurence Sterne. It follows the Reverend Mr. Yorick on a picaresque journey through France, narrated from a sentimental point of view. Yorick is a character from Sterne's bestselling previous novel Tristram Shandy (1759–1767) who also serves as Sterne's alter ego. The novel was planned as a four-volume work, but Sterne died in 1768 with only the first two volumes published; Yorick never makes it to Italy.\n\nThe book follows the genre conventions of a travel narrative, with a playful and fragmented writing style. A key theme is the interconnected nature of sympathy and sexual desire, which both inspire strong pro-social feelings. Analysis of the book often seeks to answer whether its depictions of extreme emotion are meant to be serious, or whether Yorick is an unreliable narrator intended to mock the eighteenth-century culture of sensibility.\n\nAt its first publication, A Sentimental Journey was widely praised for being more emotionally moving and less bawdy than Tristram Shandy. In the first decades after his death, A Sentimental Journey was Sterne's most popular work. Victorian readers disapproved more strongly of its sexual content, and its reputation declined. In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, a rehabilitation of Sterne generated more interest in the novel, though it is often now overshadowed by Tristram Shandy.\n\nPlot summary\nYorick's journey starts in Calais, where he meets a monk who begs for donations to his convent. Yorick initially refuses to give him anything, but later regrets his decision. He and the monk exchange their snuff-boxes as a gesture of friendship. He sees a woman, Madame L—, and is intrigued by her; he will continue to encounter her throughout the novel. Yorick buys a chaise to continue his journey. Yorick then inserts a preface cataloguing different kinds of travellers.\n\nAfter some time in Calais, the next town he visits is Montreuil, where he hires a servant to accompany him on his journey, a young man named La Fleur. Along the way, they pass a man mourning for his dead ass; Yorick sympathizes with him, but his sympathy is interrupted by his carriage driving away too quickly. They travel through Nampont and Amiens before arriving in Paris.\n\nIn Paris, he is distracted by the beauty of a shop girl (grisette) when he asks her for directions to the Opera Comique. After the opera, Yorick is informed that the police inquired for his passport at his hotel. Without a passport at a time when England is at war with France, he risks imprisonment in the Bastille. He sees a starling in a cage, which seems to be repeating the phrase \"I can't get out\"; he is unable to free it and, dwelling on its captivity, becomes miserable imagining the suffering of a prisoner in the Bastille.\n\nYorick travels to Versailles to acquire a passport, and visits the Count de B****. When Yorick notices the count reads Hamlet, he points with his finger at Yorick's name, mentioning that he is Yorick. The count mistakes him for the king's jester and quickly procures him a passport. Yorick fails in his attempt to correct the count, and remains satisfied with receiving his passport so quickly.\n\nYorick returns to Paris and stays a few more days before continuing his voyage to Italy. He visits Maria—who was introduced in Sterne's previous novel, Tristram Shandy—in Moulins. Maria's mother tells Yorick that Maria has been struck with grief since her husband died. Yorick consoles Maria, and then leaves.\n\nAfter having passed Lyon during his journey, Yorick spends the night in a roadside inn. The novel ends abruptly in the middle of a scene, with a double entendre."

Polls indicated that New York Senator Hillary Clinton was leading rival Senator Barack Obama by double digits in the weeks before the contest,[1] and she ended up winning with roughly 57% of the vote. Clinton won every county in her home state except Tompkins County, home to the college town of Ithaca, which strongly supported Obama.\n\nPolls\nMain article: Statewide opinion polling for the 2008 Super Tuesday Democratic Party presidential primaries § New York\nPolls throughout the campaign indicated that Hillary Clinton, a Senator from New York, was clearly favored to win the New York primary. She won every poll conducted in the state by double digits except one, and got more than 40% in every poll conducted, even with various challengers. After the number of candidates dropped significantly in late January, Clinton won 50% or more in every poll but one.\n\nVote discrepancies\n\nNew York is announced as part of the roll call of the states during the third day of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado. New Mexico had yielded to Illinois, which in turn yielded to New York so that Senator Hillary Clinton could make a motion promoting party unity.\nAfter the votes were initially counted on election night, certain districts near New York City were found to be missing their vote tallies for Obama.[2] The New York Times conducted a review of the unofficial results from the primary. They found that, among New York City's 6,106 election districts participating, 80 districts did not record a single vote for Obama, including heavily black districts like Harlem, as well as districts next to others where Obama had very favorable results. City election officials reviewed the vote tallies and found several inaccuracies. For example, in Harlem where Clinton led Obama 141 to 0, the recounted vote was counted as 261 to 136, Clinton.[3] In Brooklyn the primary night vote was 118 to 0, Clinton, whereas the recounted vote went 118 to 116, Clinton.[3]\n\nDemocratic leaders blamed the discrepancies on \"human error\" due to weary election officials on primary day. According to ABC News, however, other candidates such as John Edwards did not have this problem; it seemed to be almost exclusive to Obama.[4]\n\nThe counting errors only occurred in the election night tallies, which are always unofficial. Following normal procedures, the votes were re-tallied before being officially certified.[5] The final, official results left Clinton with 139 pledged delegates to the 2008 Democratic National Convention and Obama with 93.[6]",

      "Summarize this story about friendship by Lindsay Flo.  Bold any words that relate to friendship.  Underline the names of any characters in the text. \n\nAlice was everywhere, until she wasn’t. Just like at first, she was nowhere until she was. The absence of her before I knew she existed, was nothing. Now, the absence of her shrouds everything. Like a guest who never came to dinner; a stormy sky that didn’t deliver. Nothing can wash away the void where she used to be. This is what I’m thinking about the first time I take The Walk without her.\n\n\nI met Alice at a dinner party, the raucous kind with wild guests, beautiful people glittering in late summer air on a second-floor balcony backlit by a September sky. We were all friends of Richard, and this was his brilliant attempt to make all the people I love come together. Or it was a lavish birthday party thrown for himself. You could never quite tell with Richard.\n\n\nHe was my hairdresser, but I was included among the people he loved the most, and so was Alice. From across the table, her eyes kept locking mine with interest: hers large and dark and layered with mischief. Her husband was older, serene. A balm to her boisterousness.\n\n\nI know you from somewhere, she’d said, that night when there was both sweltering heat and a prelude of autumn in the air. We sipped deep, earthy Bordeaux and had the getting-to-know-you conversation. The what-do-you-do, are-you-married, do-you-have-kids variety.\n\n\nA week later, on my morning run with Copper, I ran into Alice again and now we knew. This is where I see you! We both exclaimed it as we came into each other’s space on the trail, the wide, flat former track bed for trains. Copper panted at my side, not used to the interruption in our run. Alice was delighted. Although she didn’t run, I agreed to slow it to a power walk and changed direction, pulling a confused Copper along. The winds shifted: the weather and my life, simultaneously.\n\n\nI had been passing Alice on the trail forever. Her Nordic ponytail, so blonde it was nearly white, had been in my peripheral vision for years. In the winter she was encapsulated in bright, good-quality warmth: red Patagonia outerwear and a multi-colored hat from another dimension, such was the insanity of its pattern. Her body was fit and lithe; ageless, from a lifetime of The Walk.\n\n\nThe Walk is so important, she’d tell me, but she didn’t have to tell me. I stopped running, and my knees responded with finally! For the love of God stop trying to break us, you aren’t young anymore! Alice, who I had flown by in summers before, barely noticing her, became my near daily companion and without the run, The Walk became essential. My knees, at age forty, were dissolving like broken concrete, but I still needed the exercise, and, as it turns out, the companionship.\n\n\nWe figured out that winter we’d been passing each other more places than the trail. We had circled each other forever, near collisions and missed encounters. Richard was the hub that had put us on the balcony that night, Richard who collected people like trophies, beautiful and successful ones. His Instagram had thousands of followers.\n\n\nBut he doesn’t really have friends, you know? Alice observed, and I agreed. Richard was a perpetuator of vanity posting and humble brags, king of the selfie with #nofilter. In person, you could see the ruddy undertones of his skin and his bleached hair wasn’t quite so effervescent. His need to be complimented was painfully obvious, like a giant cut that oozed blood and begged for stitches.\n\n\nWe discussed Richard at length, chiding ourselves for gossip but agreeing: what we talked about on The Walk, stayed on The Walk. It wasn’t only Richard. Soon, we discovered that we’d both worked in the same office building, for years. She: the owner of a tiny, liberal magazine. She had sat on comfy couches in jeans and sweaters drinking herbal tea and brainstorming how to get her writers to be better on the fourth floor. One level down, I had worn tailored suits in muted, professional colors—dove gray, classic black, the occasional cobalt blue. My hair was perfectly coifed (thanks to Richard) and I wore red lipstick and heels and traded stocks for rich people while advising them how to invest their life.\n\n\nWe must have seen each other a million times! I wracked my memory, trying find one in which Alice and I ride in the elevator together. I would have everything tightly in my leather bag, some feminized version of a briefcase, clasped with both hands in front of me, mentally running through the daily to-do list that forever plagued me. Alice would have been in leggings, a messenger bag slung over her body and a cardboard container with coffees for all her employees.\n\n\nNo memory came, but we could not get over how wild the universe was. We had shared that space for just under seven years, before Alice sold the magazine and retired and before I quit my job when I was faced with dragons to slay in the form of a mental breakdown.\n\n\nBut it wasn’t just work and Richard. We soon realized that we had both been at the wedding of Cassidy and Brian, who had also attended Richard’s party. Brian was a colleague of mine; I had known him for years. Cassidy was Alice’s neighbor before she married Brian. Both of us had frequently double-dated with them. Alice and the Zen husband who was placid like a golden retriever on tranquilizers. Me and David, before he died.\n\n\nWe were a good year into The Walk before I talked about David. Before I told Alice the story of how we were together forever, pushing off marriage because we were focused on our careers. Someday, we’d said, passing like strangers in the night, as I left for work and he stumbled home from his life as an ER doctor.\n\n\nOn The Walk, one day, I break down so violently we have to stop. It’s been two years since David died. It’s been one year since I walked away from my job in an attempt to salvage myself. It’s been just under one year since I stopped running and started Walking with Alice. She doesn’t say anything, and even Copper lies down on the path. He’s a Vizsla, and he’s already pissed about not running anymore, but he’s the only one who has ever been born witness to this level of rawness.\n\n\nAlice doesn’t say a word, and for this I fall in love with her. I have put up a wall between myself and every other well-meaning person in my life who has tried to compartmentalize my feelings, to attach names like grief or anger to the gaping hole in my life. As if the space where David lived could be defined. As if they could quantify what it meant to lose him.\n\n\nAfter that day, Alice asks me only once about David, and its only his name. I tell her, and her eyes grow wide and she stops The Walk to tell me that she was married before the Zen husband. For a long time. And that one day he had a heart attack, as workaholic men do, and the ER doctor who tried to save him was named Dr. David Cross.\n\n\nWas it him? she asks me, tears glistening like a lighthouse beacon, flavored with something far away. I nod, rapt with hunger to hear of the moment when Alice met David. She tells me how it went down. How very young the doctor seemed. How he also cried, blinked back tears, as he sat in the room with her, the one where they took people to tell them that their loved one didn’t make it.\n\n\nDavid often came home with the broken heart of a man trying to meld science and God. So often, he laid his head on me, told me a story—a mother falling to her knees, a husband. A wife. I tried to extract the memory, so sure was I that he must have cried into my hair one dark morning about Alice. Must have told me about the beautiful blonde woman with the supple body that had fully expected her husband to make it.\n\n\nMy God, its like we were supposed to meet! Alice recovers from the brief trip back in time, to a place where darkness kept her isolated until the Zen husband materialized. It was like Dorothy arriving in Kansas when he did. It wasn’t home, not exactly, but everything was beautiful and colorful and magical again.\n\n\nMost of The Walks were not so deep. Alice was older than me, a young septuagenarian. She was certain I’d fall in love again, so much so that she told me not to worry about it and to let her handle it. I laughed and indulged her, saying yes when she suggested we take The Walk into her neighborhood because there’s a very, very cute man who lives on the corner and I’ve already told him I have a hot stockbroker friend!\n\n\nWe did The Walk in all the seasons. Winter was Alice’s favorite, when the air was the cleanest and Copper shone like fire against the snow. Alice convinced me to let him loose, assuring me that once he was free, he would never leave. Her logic made no sense, and yet she was right. After nearly a decade of straining on his leash, Copper took a few laps and returns to us, contentedly sniffing along.  \n\n\nSummer was my favorite, with the sun that turned me golden for the first time in years, as I was no longer in an office for ten hours a day. I was circling a drain of my own imposing, a two-year mark in which carefully allocated funds would be used up, and I'd have to return to work. Alice said screw that and reminded me that I know how to make more money, that I’m the investment genius after all. I told her it’s not that simple, but I cannot help delighting in the way my hair has lightened and the way the day feels like forever when you’re outside to enjoy it.\n\n\nWe both love fall; after all, this is when we met for the first time on a conscious plane of existence. We commemorated two years of knowing each other one September morning, agreeing to abort The Walk in favor of breakfast. Alice said she'd pick me up, that she knew a great little diner off the beaten path. She took me to a place called The Bean, and I suppose I should've be shocked but I wasn't, not after all this time.\n\n\nI love this place, she says to me. I used to get coffee almost every morning on my way to work.\n\n\nMe too, I say, and inside she revealed her ulterior motive for bringing me here, to a place I haven’t once visited or come to since my self-imposed sabbatical.\n\n\nLook, she whispered, as if we were detectives solving a crime. No, don’t be obvious! Look at the guy behind the counter!\n\n\nI eyed the barista and rolled my eyes. While I agreed that he was adorable, I reminded Alice that I’m forty-two years old and the barista is a child, maybe twenty if that. Alice didn't care.\n\n\nAge is just a number! Look at the Zen husband! He’s years older than me. It doesn’t matter! I’m telling you. Your soulmate is right around the corner, I can feel it.\n\n\nBefore I could say that David was my soulmate, she waved her hand as if brushing a fly off my shoulder. She pushed my coffee across the table towards me, she held the moment with her eyes and her secret smile. We have lots of soulmates, don’t you think? I gushed with gratitude inside, knowing what she wasn’t saying. This friendship, this life we’ve led alongside one another without even knowing about it, has undoubtedly been orchestrated by some type of higher power.\n\n\nWhen spring comes, Alice insists that she’s very close to figuring out who my new soulmate will be, and that she’ll be the one to introduce us. I’m telling you, this is happening!\n\n\nI side-eye her, ash-colored hair trailing in the spring breeze that’s rousing all the pollen, the main reason Alice dislikes spring. She carries an inhaler and has tissues in her pocket even though I suggest we skip on days when the pollen count is high. I’ve started to believe that she’s correct and feel a bit excited for the future. I tack on another six months to my sabbatical.\n\n\nThe Walk has become a near daily staple. Alice has become the best friend I’ve ever had. Copper is settling into his geriatric-hood with ease, like a fresh sheet billowing over a bed. The dark parts of my life have feathered away into just strands, and I have spent gobs of money on a therapist but both he and I agree The Walk has been an even greater part of my healing. David can now exist in my mind with bittersweet nostalgia instead of shards of pain.\n\n\nOne day in late April, Alice collapses on The Walk.\n\n\nIt’s preposterous—Alice is healthy and we walk daily and she does yoga and Pilates and spin and takes an adult tap class—but there she is, lying on the packed dirt that is dry already from a spring where rain eludes us. Copper panics, and when he does, I know something is horribly wrong. I don’t know what to do—I don’t know CPR and other than her asthma, I don’t know what could be wrong. In the end, I dial 911, and the operator tries to guide me through resuscitation. My lips feel gummy against Alice’s; my hands feel as though they are crossing some boundary as they push heavily on her chest.\n\n\nCome on, I say to her, and in my head, I’m already narrating the story we will tell, of how she collapsed, and I saved her. We will tell our friends at dinner and there will be some innocuous but easily fixable culprit: a heart valve that’s repaired perfectly, a piece of chewing gum that became lodged in her airway. Nothing that will change anything at all.\n\n\nThe story, it turns out, ends with Alice dying.\n\n\nI go in the ambulance with Alice, a vaguely familiar hiker at the head of the trail offering to take Copper back home and deposit him into my fenced in yard. Copper’s eyes tell me it’s okay, that he will be safe with this stranger. In the waiting room of the ER, I dial the Zen husband, but I only get his voicemail. I leave him a message, keeping it breezy, because I’m still writing the fantasy in my head where she lives.\n\n\nBut she doesn’t. The doctor who comes out to tell me is astonishingly handsome. He looks like David if David had been allowed to age. I collapse into a primal howl, I seem to shake both of us, as if a widow and an ER doctor were new to death. Brain aneurysm, he tells me.\n\n\nWhen I leave, he assures me the Zen husband is on his way and not to worry, he will handle it. But it doesn’t matter. Alice is gone. I Uber myself home, eternally grateful to find that Copper’s babysitter has done what I’ve asked and deposited him in my backyard. I collapse on my couch, wanting David. Wanting Alice. I have lived too much of my life without her and now, she dies? It’s not fair. I will never Walk without her, I vow.\n\n\nDays later, I break the vow, because of Copper. Because I want to leave a note at the trailhead to thank the man who I trusted with Copper and my address and my gate code. Because Copper is a Vizsla, and he needs exercise. I am achingly aware of the empty space beside me, like a bubble that has popped. I would give anything to see Alice round the bend ahead, her familiar gait, one of her crazy hats and her wild blonde hair.\n\n\nBut she doesn’t, and when I get to the point where we usually turn around, I sit down and cry again. I can hear her, I swear I can, as if the wind rustling is really her and my magical thinking is really true. After awhile it calms down and everything is silent again. When I stand to turn back, the leash-less Copper bolts ahead to inspect a person who’s come around the bend. Again, for a half-second, I dream that its Alice.\n\n\nIt’s not Alice, but by some strange coincidence, it’s the man who took Copper home for me. Incredulously, I show him the note I was going to post, I pump his hand in thanks and when I touch him, I feel something pass between us, as if I’ve been here before. I can tell he feels it too. Copper pants beside us.\n\n\nThis might seem weird, the man says, but do you want to walk with me?\n\n\nOkay, I say, and Copper takes off ahead of us.\n\n\nIs your friend okay? He asks this with genuine concern, with kindness, and the jolt of remembrance nearly knocks me off-balance. I can hear Alice’s words: I’m going to find him for you, your next soulmate. I suddenly realize, without a doubt, that she’s fulfilled her promise. I have no logical reason for believing this, and yet, I do.\n\n\nShe didn’t make it, I breathe out, and I find myself telling the story of Alice and our parallel lives and explaining The Walk and how much I miss her—telling it all to this stranger. We start talking about our lives and we don’t stop for the entire Walk.\n\n\nUp ahead, Copper runs free."

      "I'm interested in this butternut squash recipe but I need the instructions to be written more straight-forward. Can you shorten this recipe by half of the words and give me the main instructions in a bulleted list:\n\n\"Instructions\n\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit and line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the butternut squash on the pan and drizzle each half with just enough olive oil to lightly coat the squash on the inside (about ½ teaspoon each). Rub the oil over the inside of the squash and sprinkle it with salt and pepper.\nTurn the squash face down and roast until it is tender and completely cooked through, about 40 to 50 minutes (don’t worry if the skin or flesh browns—that’s good for flavor). Set the squash aside until it’s cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes.\nMeanwhile, in a large soup pot, warm 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat until shimmering (if your blender has a soup preset, use a medium skillet to minimize dishes.) Add the chopped shallot and 1 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring often, until the shallot has softened and is starting to turn golden on the edges, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute, stirring frequently. Transfer the contents to your stand blender (see notes on how to use an immersion blender instead).\n\nUse a large spoon to scoop the butternut squash flesh into your blender. Discard the tough skin. Add the maple syrup, nutmeg and a few twists of freshly ground black pepper to the blender. Pour in 3 cups vegetable broth, being careful not to fill the container past the maximum fill line (you can work in batches if necessary, and stir in any remaining broth later).\nSecurely fasten the lid. Blend on high (or select the soup preset, if available), being careful to avoid hot steam escaping from the lid. Stop once your soup is ultra creamy and warmed through.\nIf you would like to thin out your soup a bit more, stir in the remaining cup of broth. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons butter or olive oil, to taste, and blend well. Taste and stir in more salt and pepper, if necessary.\nIf your soup is piping hot from the blending process, you can pour it into serving bowls. If not, pour it back into your soup pot and warm the soup over medium heat, stirring often, until it’s nice and steamy. I like to top individual bowls with some extra black pepper.\""

      "Could you summarize the plot of the Catcher in the Rye. I would like the summary to be at least 6 sentences long and include a brief discussion of the book's themes. Also be sure to include where the book is set.",
      "*The Catcher in the Rye*, penned by J.D. Salinger, unfolds primarily in and around New York City during the 1950s. The story is narrated by Holden Caulfield, a 16 - year - old who has just been expelled from Pencey Prep, a prestigious boarding school. Holden is disillusioned with the \"phoniness\" he perceives in the adult world. Instead of going straight home to face his parents' disappointment, he decides to wander around New York City for a few days.\n\nDuring his time in the city, Holden has a series of encounters that further expose him to the shallowness and insincerity he loathes. He visits a nightclub, tries to connect with an old girlfriend, and even hires a prostitute, but none of these experiences bring him the comfort or fulfillment he seeks. He is deeply troubled by the loss of his younger brother Allie, whose death has left a lasting impact on his psyche.\n\nAs the days pass, Holden's mental state deteriorates. He becomes increasingly isolated and lonely, constantly longing for genuine human connection. His search for authenticity in a world full of pretense becomes more and more desperate. Eventually, he contemplates running away to the west, but in the end, he decides to return home.\n\nOne of the central themes of the book is the transition from adolescence to adulthood. Holden is terrified of growing up and losing the innocence he associates with childhood. He sees adulthood as a world filled with phonies and hypocrites, and he wants to protect the purity he believes exists in children. This is symbolized by his fantasy of being the \"catcher in the rye,\" saving children from falling off a cliff while they play in a field of rye.\n\nAnother important theme is alienation. Holden feels like an outsider in society. He struggles to form meaningful relationships, and his inability to fit in makes him deeply unhappy. His isolation is both self - imposed, as he often pushes people away, and a result of his perception of the world around him.\n\nIn conclusion, *The Catcher in the Rye* is a poignant exploration of teenage angst, the search for identity, and the disillusionment that can come with growing up. Through Holden's experiences in New York City, Salinger delves into the complex emotions and challenges faced by adolescents on the cusp of adulthood. ",

He is restrained by Andy and Shen, but his comment about Isshin enrages Top, who breaks his neck with a kick to Tatiana's horror. Everyone thinks this kills him, but he suddenly stands up and declares he will be the one to kill God, whereupon Burn, with Latla and Rip on his shoulders, bursts through the ground and grabs the Roundtable.

Underline and bold the names of the historical figures.\n\nRavenna\nI.\n\nA year ago I breathed the Italian air,—\nAnd yet, methinks this northern Spring is fair,—\nThese fields made golden with the flower of March,\nThe throstle singing on the feathered larch,\nThe cawing rooks, the wood-doves fluttering by,\nThe little clouds that race across the sky;\nAnd fair the violet’s gentle drooping head,\nThe primrose, pale for love uncomforted,\nThe rose that burgeons on the climbing briar,\nThe crocus-bed, (that seems a moon of fire\nRound-girdled with a purple marriage-ring);\nAnd all the flowers of our English Spring,\nFond snowdrops, and the bright-starred daffodil.\nUp starts the lark beside the murmuring mill,\nAnd breaks the gossamer-threads of early dew;\nAnd down the river, like a flame of blue,\nKeen as an arrow flies the water-king,\nWhile the brown linnets in the greenwood sing.\nA year ago!—it seems a little time\nSince last I saw that lordly southern clime,\np. 308Where flower and fruit to purple radiance blow,\nAnd like bright lamps the fabled apples glow.\nFull Spring it was—and by rich flowering vines,\nDark olive-groves and noble forest-pines,\nI rode at will; the moist glad air was sweet,\nThe white road rang beneath my horse’s feet,\nAnd musing on Ravenna’s ancient name,\nI watched the day till, marked with wounds of flame,\nThe turquoise sky to burnished gold was turned.\n\n   O how my heart with boyish passion burned,\nWhen far away across the sedge and mere\nI saw that Holy City rising clear,\nCrowned with her crown of towers!—On and on\nI galloped, racing with the setting sun,\nAnd ere the crimson after-glow was passed,\nI stood within Ravenna’s walls at last!\n\nII.\n\n   How strangely still! no sound of life or joy\nStartles the air; no laughing shepherd-boy\nPipes on his reed, nor ever through the day\nComes the glad sound of children at their play:\nO sad, and sweet, and silent! surely here\nA man might dwell apart from troublous fear,\nWatching the tide of seasons as they flow\nFrom amorous Spring to Winter’s rain and snow,\np. 309And have no thought of sorrow;—here, indeed,\nAre Lethe’s waters, and that fatal weed\nWhich makes a man forget his fatherland.\n\n   Ay! amid lotus-meadows dost thou stand,\nLike Proserpine, with poppy-laden head,\nGuarding the holy ashes of the dead.\nFor though thy brood of warrior sons hath ceased,\nThy noble dead are with thee!—they at least\nAre faithful to thine honour:—guard them well,\nO childless city! for a mighty spell,\nTo wake men’s hearts to dreams of things sublime,\nAre the lone tombs where rest the Great of Time.\n\nIII.\n\n   Yon lonely pillar, rising on the plain,\nMarks where the bravest knight of France was slain,—\nThe Prince of chivalry, the Lord of war,\nGaston de Foix: for some untimely star\nLed him against thy city, and he fell,\nAs falls some forest-lion fighting well.\nTaken from life while life and love were new,\nHe lies beneath God’s seamless veil of blue;\nTall lance-like reeds wave sadly o’er his head,\nAnd oleanders bloom to deeper red,\np. 310Where his bright youth flowed crimson on the ground.\n\n   Look farther north unto that broken mound,—\nThere, prisoned now within a lordly tomb\nRaised by a daughter’s hand, in lonely gloom,\nHuge-limbed Theodoric, the Gothic king,\nSleeps after all his weary conquering.\nTime hath not spared his ruin,—wind and rain\nHave broken down his stronghold; and again\nWe see that Death is mighty lord of all,\nAnd king and clown to ashen dust must fall\n\n   Mighty indeed their glory! yet to me\nBarbaric king, or knight of chivalry,\nOr the great queen herself, were poor and vain,\nBeside the grave where Dante rests from pain.\nHis gilded shrine lies open to the air;\nAnd cunning sculptor’s hands have carven there\nThe calm white brow, as calm as earliest morn,\nThe eyes that flashed with passionate love and scorn,\nThe lips that sang of Heaven and of Hell,\nThe almond-face which Giotto drew so well,\nThe weary face of Dante;—to this day,\nHere in his place of resting, far away\nFrom Arno’s yellow waters, rushing down\nThrough the wide bridges of that fairy town,\nWhere the tall tower of Giotto seems to rise\nA marble lily under sapphire skies!\n\np. 311Alas! my Dante! thou hast known the pain\nOf meaner lives,—the exile’s galling chain,\nHow steep the stairs within kings’ houses are,\nAnd all the petty miseries which mar\nMan’s nobler nature with the sense of wrong.\nYet this dull world is grateful for thy song;\nOur nations do thee homage,—even she,\nThat cruel queen of vine-clad Tuscany,\nWho bound with crown of thorns thy living brow,\nHath decked thine empty tomb with laurels now,\nAnd begs in vain the ashes of her son.\n\n   O mightiest exile! all thy grief is done:\nThy soul walks now beside thy Beatrice;\nRavenna guards thine ashes: sleep in peace.\n\nIV.\n\n   How lone this palace is; how grey the walls!\nNo minstrel now wakes echoes in these halls.\nThe broken chain lies rusting on the door,\nAnd noisome weeds have split the marble floor:\nHere lurks the snake, and here the lizards run\nBy the stone lions blinking in the sun.\nByron dwelt here in love and revelry\nFor two long years—a second Anthony,\np. 312Who of the world another Actium made!\nYet suffered not his royal soul to fade,\nOr lyre to break, or lance to grow less keen,\n’Neath any wiles of an Egyptian queen.\nFor from the East there came a mighty cry,\nAnd Greece stood up to fight for Liberty,\nAnd called him from Ravenna: never knight\nRode forth more nobly to wild scenes of fight!\nNone fell more bravely on ensanguined field,\nBorne like a Spartan back upon his shield!\nO Hellas!  Hellas! in thine hour of pride,\nThy day of might, remember him who died\nTo wrest from off thy limbs the trammelling chain:\nO Salamis!  O lone Platæan plain!\nO tossing waves of wild Euboean sea!\nO wind-swept heights of lone Thermopylæ!\nHe loved you well—ay, not alone in word,\nWho freely gave to thee his lyre and sword,\nLike Æschylos at well-fought Marathon:\n\n   And England, too, shall glory in her son,\nHer warrior-poet, first in song and fight.\nNo longer now shall Slander’s venomed spite\nCrawl like a snake across his perfect name,\nOr mar the lordly scutcheon of his fame.\n\n   For as the olive-garland of the race,\nWhich lights with joy each eager runner’s face,\np. 313As the red cross which saveth men in war,\nAs a flame-bearded beacon seen from far\nBy mariners upon a storm-tossed sea,—\nSuch was his love for Greece and Liberty!\n\n   Byron, thy crowns are ever fresh and green:\nRed leaves of rose from Sapphic Mitylene\nShall bind thy brows; the myrtle blooms for thee,\nIn hidden glades by lonely Castaly;\nThe laurels wait thy coming: all are thine,\nAnd round thy head one perfect wreath will twine.\n\nV.\n\n   The pine-tops rocked before the evening breeze\nWith the hoarse murmur of the wintry seas,\nAnd the tall stems were streaked with amber bright;—\nI wandered through the wood in wild delight,\nSome startled bird, with fluttering wings and fleet,\nMade snow of all the blossoms; at my feet,\nLike silver crowns, the pale narcissi lay,\nAnd small birds sang on every twining spray.\nO waving trees, O forest liberty!\nWithin your haunts at least a man is free,\nAnd half forgets the weary world of strife:\nThe blood flows hotter, and a sense of life\np. 314Wakes i’ the quickening veins, while once again\nThe woods are filled with gods we fancied slain.\nLong time I watched, and surely hoped to see\nSome goat-foot Pan make merry minstrelsy\nAmid the reeds! some startled Dryad-maid\nIn girlish flight! or lurking in the glade,\nThe soft brown limbs, the wanton treacherous face\nOf woodland god! Queen Dian in the chase,\nWhite-limbed and terrible, with look of pride,\nAnd leash of boar-hounds leaping at her side!\nOr Hylas mirrored in the perfect stream.\n\n   O idle heart!  O fond Hellenic dream!\nEre long, with melancholy rise and swell,\nThe evening chimes, the convent’s vesper bell,\nStruck on mine ears amid the amorous flowers.\nAlas! alas! these sweet and honied hours\nHad whelmed my heart like some encroaching sea,\nAnd drowned all thoughts of black Gethsemane.\n\nVI.\n\n   O lone Ravenna! many a tale is told\nOf thy great glories in the days of old:\nTwo thousand years have passed since thou didst see\nCæsar ride forth to royal victory.\np. 315Mighty thy name when Rome’s lean eagles flew\nFrom Britain’s isles to far Euphrates blue;\nAnd of the peoples thou wast noble queen,\nTill in thy streets the Goth and Hun were seen.\nDiscrowned by man, deserted by the sea,\nThou sleepest, rocked in lonely misery!\nNo longer now upon thy swelling tide,\nPine-forest-like, thy myriad galleys ride!\nFor where the brass-beaked ships were wont to float,\nThe weary shepherd pipes his mournful note;\nAnd the white sheep are free to come and go\nWhere Adria’s purple waters used to flow.\n\n   O fair!  O sad!  O Queen uncomforted!\nIn ruined loveliness thou liest dead,\nAlone of all thy sisters; for at last\nItalia’s royal warrior hath passed\nRome’s lordliest entrance, and hath worn his crown\nIn the high temples of the Eternal Town!\nThe Palatine hath welcomed back her king,\nAnd with his name the seven mountains ring!\n\n   And Naples hath outlived her dream of pain,\nAnd mocks her tyrant!  Venice lives again,\nNew risen from the waters! and the cry\nOf Light and Truth, of Love and Liberty,\nIs heard in lordly Genoa, and where\nThe marble spires of Milan wound the air,\np. 316Rings from the Alps to the Sicilian shore,\nAnd Dante’s dream is now a dream no more.\n\n   But thou, Ravenna, better loved than all,\nThy ruined palaces are but a pall\nThat hides thy fallen greatness! and thy name\nBurns like a grey and flickering candle-flame\nBeneath the noonday splendour of the sun\nOf new Italia! for the night is done,\nThe night of dark oppression, and the day\nHath dawned in passionate splendour: far away\nThe Austrian hounds are hunted from the land,\nBeyond those ice-crowned citadels which stand\nGirdling the plain of royal Lombardy,\nFrom the far West unto the Eastern sea.\n\n   I know, indeed, that sons of thine have died\nIn Lissa’s waters, by the mountain-side\nOf Aspromonte, on Novara’s plain,—\nNor have thy children died for thee in vain:\nAnd yet, methinks, thou hast not drunk this wine\nFrom grapes new-crushed of Liberty divine,\nThou hast not followed that immortal Star\nWhich leads the people forth to deeds of war.\nWeary of life, thou liest in silent sleep,\nAs one who marks the lengthening shadows creep,\nCareless of all the hurrying hours that run,\nMourning some day of glory, for the sun\np. 317Of Freedom hath not shewn to thee his face,\nAnd thou hast caught no flambeau in the race.\n\n   Yet wake not from thy slumbers,—rest thee well,\nAmidst thy fields of amber asphodel,\nThy lily-sprinkled meadows,—rest thee there,\nTo mock all human greatness: who would dare\nTo vent the paltry sorrows of his life\nBefore thy ruins, or to praise the strife\nOf kings’ ambition, and the barren pride\nOf warring nations! wert not thou the Bride\nOf the wild Lord of Adria’s stormy sea!\nThe Queen of double Empires! and to thee\nWere not the nations given as thy prey!\nAnd now—thy gates lie open night and day,\nThe grass grows green on every tower and hall,\nThe ghastly fig hath cleft thy bastioned wall;\nAnd where thy mailèd warriors stood at rest\nThe midnight owl hath made her secret nest.\nO fallen! fallen! from thy high estate,\nO city trammelled in the toils of Fate,\nDoth nought remain of all thy glorious days,\nBut a dull shield, a crown of withered bays!\n\n   Yet who beneath this night of wars and fears,\nFrom tranquil tower can watch the coming years;\nWho can foretell what joys the day shall bring,\nOr why before the dawn the linnets sing?\np. 318Thou, even thou, mayst wake, as wakes the rose\nTo crimson splendour from its grave of snows;\nAs the rich corn-fields rise to red and gold\nFrom these brown lands, now stiff with Winter’s cold;\nAs from the storm-rack comes a perfect star!\n\n   O much-loved city!  I have wandered far\nFrom the wave-circled islands of my home;\nHave seen the gloomy mystery of the Dome\nRise slowly from the drear Campagna’s way,\nClothed in the royal purple of the day:\nI from the city of the violet crown\nHave watched the sun by Corinth’s hill go down,\nAnd marked the ‘myriad laughter’ of the sea\nFrom starlit hills of flower-starred Arcady;\nYet back to thee returns my perfect love,\nAs to its forest-nest the evening dove.\n\n   O poet’s city! one who scarce has seen\nSome twenty summers cast their doublets green\nFor Autumn’s livery, would seek in vain\nTo wake his lyre to sing a louder strain,\nOr tell thy days of glory;—poor indeed\nIs the low murmur of the shepherd’s reed,\nWhere the loud clarion’s blast should shake the sky,\nAnd flame across the heavens! and to try\nSuch lofty themes were folly: yet I know\nThat never felt my heart a nobler glow\np. 319Than when I woke the silence of thy street\nWith clamorous trampling of my horse’s feet,\nAnd saw the city which now I try to sing,\nAfter long days of weary travelling.\n\nVII.\n\n   Adieu, Ravenna! but a year ago,\nI stood and watched the crimson sunset glow\nFrom the lone chapel on thy marshy plain:\nThe sky was as a shield that caught the stain\nOf blood and battle from the dying sun,\nAnd in the west the circling clouds had spun\nA royal robe, which some great God might wear,\nWhile into ocean-seas of purple air\nSank the gold galley of the Lord of Light.\n\n   Yet here the gentle stillness of the night\nBrings back the swelling tide of memory,\nAnd wakes again my passionate love for thee:\nNow is the Spring of Love, yet soon will come\nOn meadow and tree the Summer’s lordly bloom;\nAnd soon the grass with brighter flowers will blow,\nAnd send up lilies for some boy to mow.\nThen before long the Summer’s conqueror,\nRich Autumn-time, the season’s usurer,\nWill lend his hoarded gold to all the trees,\np. 320And see it scattered by the spendthrift breeze;\nAnd after that the Winter cold and drear.\nSo runs the perfect cycle of the year.\nAnd so from youth to manhood do we go,\nAnd fall to weary days and locks of snow.\nLove only knows no winter; never dies:\nNor cares for frowning storms or leaden skies\nAnd mine for thee shall never pass away,\nThough my weak lips may falter in my lay.\n\n   Adieu!  Adieu! yon silent evening star,\nThe night’s ambassador, doth gleam afar,\nAnd bid the shepherd bring his flocks to fold.\nPerchance before our inland seas of gold\nAre garnered by the reapers into sheaves,\nPerchance before I see the Autumn leaves,\nI may behold thy city; and lay down\nLow at thy feet the poet’s laurel crown.\n\n   Adieu!  Adieu! yon silver lamp, the moon,\nWhich turns our midnight into perfect noon,\nDoth surely light thy towers, guarding well\nWhere Dante sleeps, where Byron loved to dwell."

      "Summarize the following text into three sentences, one sentence per paragraph, that can easily be displayed as bullet points for a Power Point presentation.\n\nThe practical basis for rabbinic authority involves the acceptance of the rabbinic individual and their scholarly credentials. In practical terms, Jewish communities and individuals commonly proffer allegiance to the authority of the rabbi they have chosen. Such a rabbinic leader is sometimes called the \"Master of the Locale\". Jewish individuals may acknowledge the authority of others but will defer legal decisions to the mara d'atra.\n\nThe rabbi derives authority from achievements within a meritocratic system. Rabbis' authority is neither nominal nor spiritual—it is based on credentials. Typically the rabbi receives an institutional stamp of approval. It is this authority that allows them to engage in the halakhic process and make legal prescriptions.\n\nThe same pattern is true within broader communities, ranging from Hasidic communities to rabbinical or congregational organizations: there will be a formal or de facto structure of rabbinic authority that is responsible for the members of the community. However, Hasidic communities do not have a mere rabbi: they have a Rebbe, who plays a similar role but is thought to have a special connection to God. The Rebbes' authority, then, is based on a spiritual connection to God and so they are venerated in a different way from rabbis."

Please restrict your bullet points to one sentence each.\n\nTHE MAN FROM SNOWY RIVER by A.B. \"Banjo\" Paterson\nThere was movement at the station, for the word had passed around\nThat the colt from old Regret had got away,\nAnd had joined the wild bush horses - he was worth a thousand pound,\nSo all the cracks had gathered to the fray.\nAll the tried and noted riders from the stations near and far\nHad mustered at the homestead overnight,\nFor the bushmen love hard riding where the wild bush horses are,\nAnd the stockhorse snuffs the battle with delight.\n\n\nThere was Harrison, who made his pile when Pardon won the cup,\nThe old man with his hair as white as snow;\nBut few could ride beside him when his blood was fairly up -\nHe would go wherever horse and man could go.\nAnd Clancy of the Overflow came down to lend a hand,\nNo better horseman ever held the reins;\nFor never horse could throw him while the saddle girths would stand,\nHe learnt to ride while droving on the plains.\n\n\nAnd one was there, a stripling on a small and weedy beast,\nHe was something like a racehorse undersized,\nWith a touch of Timor pony - three parts thoroughbred at least -\nAnd such as are by mountain horsemen prized.\nHe was hard and tough and wiry - just the sort that won't say die -\nThere was courage in his quick impatient tread;\nAnd he bore the badge of gameness in his bright and fiery eye,\nAnd the proud and lofty carriage of his head.\n\n\nBut still so slight and weedy, one would doubt his power to stay,\nAnd the old man said, \"That horse will never do\nFor a long a tiring gallop - lad, you'd better stop away,\nThose hills are far too rough for such as you.\"\nSo he waited sad and wistful - only Clancy stood his friend -\n\"I think we ought to let him come,\" he said;\n\"I warrant he'll be with us when he's wanted at the end,\nFor both his horse and he are mountain bred.\n\n\n\"He hails from Snowy River, up by Kosciusko's side,\nWhere the hills are twice as steep and twice as rough,\nWhere a horse's hoofs strike firelight from the flint stones every stride,\nThe man that holds his own is good enough.\nAnd the Snowy River riders on the mountains make their home,\nWhere the river runs those giant hills between;\nI have seen full many horsemen since I first commenced to roam,\nBut nowhere yet such horsemen have I seen.\"\n\n\nSo he went - they found the horses by the big mimosa clump -\nThey raced away towards the mountain's brow, \nAnd the old man gave his orders, \"Boys, go at them from the jump, \nNo use to try for fancy riding now. \nAnd, Clancy, you must wheel them, try and wheel them to the right. \nRide boldly, lad, and never fear the spills, \nFor never yet was rider that could keep the mob in sight, \nIf once they gain the shelter of those hills.\"\n\n\nSo Clancy rode to wheel them - he was racing on the wing \nWhere the best and boldest riders take their place, \nAnd he raced his stockhorse past them, and he made the ranges ring \nWith the stockwhip, as he met them face to face. \nThen they halted for a moment, while he swung the dreaded lash, \nBut they saw their well-loved mountain full in view, \nAnd they charged beneath the stockwhip with a sharp and sudden dash, \nAnd off into the mountain scrub they flew.\n\n\nThen fast the horsemen followed, where the gorges deep and black \nResounded to the thunder of their tread, \nAnd the stockwhips woke the echoes, and they fiercely answered back \nFrom cliffs and crags that beetled overhead. \nAnd upward, ever upward, the wild horses held their way, \nWhere mountain ash and kurrajong grew wide; \nAnd the old man muttered fiercely, \"We may bid the mob good day, \nNo man can hold them down the other side.\"\n\n\nWhen they reached the mountain's summit, even Clancy took a pull, \nIt well might make the boldest hold their breath, \nThe wild hop scrub grew thickly, and the hidden ground was full \nOf wombat holes, and any slip was death. \nBut the man from Snowy River let the pony have his head, \nAnd he swung his stockwhip round and gave a cheer, \nAnd he raced him down the mountain like a torrent down its bed, \nWhile the others stood and watched in very fear.\n\n\nHe sent the flint stones flying, but the pony kept his feet, \nHe cleared the fallen timber in his stride, \nAnd the man from Snowy River never shifted in his seat - \nIt was grand to see that mountain horseman ride. \nThrough the stringybarks and saplings, on the rough and broken ground, \nDown the hillside at a racing pace he went; \nAnd he never drew the bridle till he landed safe and sound, \nAt the bottom of that terrible descent.\n\n\nHe was right among the horses as they climbed the further hill, \nAnd the watchers on the mountain standing mute, \nSaw him ply the stockwhip fiercely, he was right among them still,\nAs he raced across the clearing in pursuit. \nThen they lost him for a moment, where two mountain gullies met \nIn the ranges, but a final glimpse reveals \nOn a dim and distant hillside the wild horses racing yet, \nWith the man from Snowy River at their heels.\n\n\nAnd he ran them single-handed till their sides were white with foam. \nHe followed like a bloodhound on their track, \nTill they halted cowed and beaten, then he turned their heads for home, \nAnd alone and unassisted brought them back. \nBut his hardy mountain pony he could scarcely raise a trot, \nHe was blood from hip to shoulder from the spur; \nBut his pluck was still undaunted, and his courage fiery hot, \nFor never yet was mountain horse a cur.\n\n\nAnd down by Kosciusko, where the pine-clad ridges raise \nTheir torn and rugged battlements on high, \nWhere the air is clear as crystal, and the white stars fairly blaze \nAt midnight in the cold and frosty sky, \nAnd where around The Overflow the reed beds sweep and sway \nTo the breezes, and the rolling plains are wide, \nThe man from Snowy River is a household word today, \nAnd the stockmen tell the story of his ride."

      "Summarize the following short story. You only need to give a very broad overview of the story, three or four short paragraphs of summary at most. Provide the summary in an informal, conversational tone. Here is the story:\n\nOlenka, the daughter of the retired collegiate assessor, Plemyanniakov, was sitting in her back porch, lost in thought. It was hot, the flies were persistent and teasing, and it was pleasant to reflect that it would soon be evening. Dark rainclouds were gathering from the east, and bringing from time to time a breath of moisture in the air.\n\nKukin, who was the manager of an open-air theatre called the Tivoli, and who lived in the lodge, was standing in the middle of the garden looking at the sky.\n\n\"Again!\" he observed despairingly. \"It's going to rain again! Rain every day, as though to spite me. I might as well hang myself! It's ruin! Fearful losses every day.\"\n\nHe flung up his hands, and went on, addressing Olenka:\n\n\"There! that's the life we lead, Olga Semyonovna. It's enough to make one cry. One works and does one's utmost, one wears oneself out, getting no sleep at night, and racks one's brain what to do for the best. And then what happens? To begin with, one's public is ignorant, boorish. I give them the very best operetta, a dainty masque, first rate music-hall artists. But do you suppose that's what they want! They don't understand anything of that sort. They want a clown; what they ask for is vulgarity. And then look at the weather! Almost every evening it rains. It started on the tenth of May, and it's kept it up all May and June. It's simply awful! The public doesn't come, but I've to pay the rent just the same, and pay the artists.\"\n\nThe next evening the clouds would gather again, and Kukin would say with an hysterical laugh:\n\n\"Well, rain away, then! Flood the garden, drown me! Damn my luck in this world and the next! Let the artists have me up! Send me to prison! -- to Siberia! -- the scaffold! Ha, ha, ha!\"\n\nAnd next day the same thing.\n\nOlenka listened to Kukin with silent gravity, and sometimes tears came into her eyes. In the end his misfortunes touched her; she grew to love him. He was a small thin man, with a yellow face, and curls combed forward on his forehead. He spoke in a thin tenor; as he talked his mouth worked on one side, and there was always an expression of despair on his face; yet he aroused a deep and genuine affection in her. She was always fond of some one, and could not exist without loving. In earlier days she had loved her papa, who now sat in a darkened room, breathing with difficulty; she had loved her aunt who used to come every other year from Bryansk; and before that, when she was at school, she had loved her French master. She was a gentle, soft-hearted, compassionate girl, with mild, tender eyes and very good health. At the sight of her full rosy cheeks, her soft white neck with a little dark mole on it, and the kind, naive smile, which came into her face when she listened to anything pleasant, men thought, \"Yes, not half bad,\" and smiled too, while lady visitors could not refrain from seizing her hand in the middle of a conversation, exclaiming in a gush of delight, \"You darling!\"\n\nThe house in which she had lived from her birth upwards, and which was left her in her father's will, was at the extreme end of the town, not far from the Tivoli. In the evenings and at night she could head the band playing, and the crackling and banging of fireworks, and it seemed to her that it was Kukin struggling with his destiny, storming the entrenchments of his chief foe, the indifferent public; there was a sweet thrill at her heart, she had no desire to sleep, and when he returned home at day-break, she tapped softly at her bedroom window, and showing him only her face and one shoulder through the curtain, she gave him a friendly smile\n\nHe proposed to her, and they were married. And when he had a closer view of her neck and her plump, fine shoulders, he threw up his hands, and said:\n\n\"You darling!\"\n\nHe was happy, but as it rained on the day and night of his wedding, his face still retained an expression of despair.\n\nThey got on very well together. She used to sit in his office, to look after things in the Tivoli, to put down the accounts and pay the wages. And her rosy cheeks, her sweet, naive, radiant smile, were to be seen now at the office window, now in the refreshment bar or behind the scenes of the theatre. And already she used to say to her acquaintances that the theatre was the chief and most important thing in life and that it was only through the drama that one could derive true enjoyment and become cultivated and humane.\n\n\"But do you suppose the public understands that?\" she used to say. \"What they want is a clown. Yesterday we gave 'Faust Inside Out,' and almost all the boxes were empty; but if Vanitchka and I had been producing some vulgar thing, I assure you the theatre would have been packed. Tomorrow Vanitchka and I are doing 'Orpheus in Hell.' Do come.\"\n\nAnd what Kukin said about the theatre and the actors she repeated. Like him she despised the public for their ignorance and their indifference to art; she took part in the rehearsals, she corrected the actors, she kept an eye on the behaviour of the musicians, and when there was an unfavourable notice in the local paper, she shed tears, and then went to the editor's office to set things right.\n\nThe actors were fond of her and used to call her \"Vanitchka and I,\" and \"the darling\"; she was sorry for them and used to lend them small sums of money, and if they deceived her, she used to shed a few tears in private, but did not complain to her husband.\n\nThey got on well in the winter too. They took the theatre in the town for the whole winter, and let it for short terms to a Little Russian company, or to a conjurer, or to a local dramatic society. Olenka grew stouter, and was always beaming with satisfaction, while Kukin grew thinner and yellower, and continually complained of their terrible losses, although he had not done badly all the winter. He used to cough at night, and she used to give him hot raspberry tea or lime-flower water, to rub him with eau-de-Cologne and to wrap him in her warm shawls.\n\n\"You're such a sweet pet!\" she used to say with perfect sincerity, stroking his hair. \"You're such a pretty dear!\"\n\nTowards Lent he went to Moscow to collect a new troupe, and without him she could not sleep, but sat all night at her window, looking at the stars, and she compared herself with the hens, who are awake all night and uneasy when the cock is not in the hen-house. Kukin was detained in Moscow, and wrote that he would be back at Easter, adding some instructions about the Tivoli. But on the Sunday before Easter, late in the evening, came a sudden ominous knock at the gate; some one was hammering on the gate as though on a barrel -- boom, boom, boom! The drowsy cook went flopping with her bare feet through the puddles, as she ran to open the gate.\n\n\"Please open,\" said some one outside in a thick bass. \"There is a telegram for you.\"\n\nOlenka had received telegrams from her husband before, but this time for some reason she felt numb with terror. With shaking hands she opened the telegram and read as follows:\n\n\"IVAN PETROVITCH DIED SUDDENLY TO-DAY. AWAITING IMMATE INSTRUCTIONS FUFUNERAL TUESDAY.\"\n\nThat was how it was written in the telegram -- \"fufuneral,\" and the utterly incomprehensible word \"immate.\" It was signed by the stage manager of the operatic company.\n\n\"My darling!\" sobbed Olenka. \"Vanka, my precious, my darling! Why did I ever meet you! Why did I know you and love you! Your poor heart-broken Olenka is alone without you!\"\n\nKukin's funeral took place on Tuesday in Moscow, Olenka returned home on Wednesday, and as soon as she got indoors, she threw herself on her bed and sobbed so loudly that it could be heard next door, and in the street.\n\n\"Poor darling!\" the neighbours said, as they crossed themselves. \"Olga Semyonovna, poor darling! How she does take on!\"\n\nThree months later Olenka was coming home from mass, melancholy and in deep mourning. It happened that one of her neighbours, Vassily Andreitch Pustovalov, returning home from church, walked back beside her. He was the manager at Babakayev's, the timber merchant's. He wore a straw hat, a white waistcoat, and a gold watch-chain, and looked more a country gentleman than a man in trade.\n\n\"Everything happens as it is ordained, Olga Semyonovna,\" he said gravely, with a sympathetic note in his voice; \"and if any of our dear ones die, it must be because it is the will of God, so we ought have fortitude and bear it submissively.\"\n\nAfter seeing Olenka to her gate, he said good-bye and went on. All day afterwards she heard his sedately dignified voice, and whenever she shut her eyes she saw his dark beard. She liked him very much. And apparently she had made an impression on him too, for not long afterwards an elderly lady, with whom she was only slightly acquainted, came to drink coffee with her, and as soon as she was seated at table began to talk about Pustovalov, saying that he was an excellent man whom one could thoroughly depend upon, and that any girl would be glad to marry him. Three days later Pustovalov came himself. He did not stay long, only about ten minutes, and he did not say much, but when he left, Olenka loved him -- loved him so much that she lay awake all night in a perfect fever, and in the morning she sent for the elderly lady. The match was quickly arranged, and then came the wedding.\n\nPustovalov and Olenka got on very well together when they were married.\n\nUsually he sat in the office till dinner-time, then he went out on business, while Olenka took his place, and sat in the office till evening, making up accounts and booking orders.\n\n\"Timber gets dearer every year; the price rises twenty per cent,\" she would say to her customers and friends. \"Only fancy we used to sell local timber, and now Vassitchka always has to go for wood to the Mogilev district. And the freight!\" she would add, covering her cheeks with her hands in horror. \"The freight!\"\n\nIt seemed to her that she had been in the timber trade for ages and ages, and that the most important and necessary thing in life was timber; and there was something intimate and touching to her in the very sound of words such as \"baulk,\" \"post,\" \"beam,\" \"pole,\" \"scantling,\" \"batten,\" \"lath,\" \"plank,\" etc.\n\nAt night when she was asleep she dreamed of perfect mountains of planks and boards, and long strings of wagons, carting timber somewhere far away. She dreamed that a whole regiment of six-inch beams forty feet high, standing on end, was marching upon the timber-yard; that logs, beams, and boards knocked together with the resounding crash of dry wood, kept falling and getting up again, piling themselves on each other. Olenka cried out in her sleep, and Pustovalov said to her tenderly: \"Olenka, what's the matter, darling? Cross yourself!\"\n\nHer husband's ideas were hers. If he thought the room was too hot, or that business was slack, she thought the same. Her husband did not care for entertainments, and on holidays he stayed at home. She did likewise.\n\n\"You are always at home or in the office,\" her friends said to her. \"You should go to the theatre, darling, or to the circus.\"\n\n\"Vassitchka and I have no time to go to theatres,\" she would answer sedately. \"We have no time for nonsense. What's the use of these theatres?\"\n\nOn Saturdays Pustovalov and she used to go to the evening service; on holidays to early mass, and they walked side by side with softened faces as they came home from church. There was a pleasant fragrance about them both, and her silk dress rustled agreeably. At home they drank tea, with fancy bread and jams of various kinds, and afterwards they ate pie. Every day at twelve o'clock there was a savoury smell of beet-root soup and of mutton or duck in their yard, and on fast-days of fish, and no one could pass the gate without feeling hungry. In the office the samovar was always boiling, and customers were regaled with tea and cracknels. Once a week the couple went to the baths and returned side by side, both red in the face.\n\n\"Yes, we have nothing to complain of, thank God,\" Olenka used to say to her acquaintances. \"I wish every one were as well off as Vassitchka and I.\"\n\nWhen Pustovalov went away to buy wood in the Mogilev district, she missed him dreadfully, lay awake and cried. A young veterinary surgeon in the army, called Smirnin, to whom they had let their lodge, used sometimes to come in in the evening. He used to talk to her and play cards with her, and this entertained her in her husband's absence. She was particularly interested in what he told her of his home life. He was married and had a little boy, but was separated from his wife because she had been unfaithful to him, and now he hated her and used to send her forty roubles a month for the maintenance of their son. And hearing of all this, Olenka sighed and shook her head. She was sorry for him.\n\n\"Well, God keep you,\" she used to say to him at parting, as she lighted him down the stairs with a candle. \"Thank you for coming to cheer me up, and may the Mother of God give you health.\"\n\nAnd she always expressed herself with the same sedateness and dignity, the same reasonableness, in imitation of her husband. As the veterinary surgeon was disappearing behind the door below, she would say:\n\n\"You know, Vladimir Platonitch, you'd better make it up with your wife. You should forgive her for the sake of your son. You may be sure the little fellow understands.\"\n\nAnd when Pustovalov came back, she told him in a low voice about the veterinary surgeon and his unhappy home life, and both sighed and shook their heads and talked about the boy, who, no doubt, missed his father, and by some strange connection of ideas, they went up to the holy ikons, bowed to the ground before them and prayed that God would give them children.\n\nAnd so the Pustovalovs lived for six years quietly and peaceably in love and complete harmony.\n\nBut behold! one winter day after drinking hot tea in the office, Vassily Andreitch went out into the yard without his cap on to see about sending off some timber, caught cold and was taken ill. He had the best doctors, but he grew worse and died after four months' illness. And Olenka was a widow once more.\n\n\"I've nobody, now you've left me, my darling,\" she sobbed, after her husband's funeral. \"How can I live without you, in wretchedness and misery! Pity me, good people, all alone in the world!\"\n\nShe went about dressed in black with long \"weepers,\" and gave up wearing hat and gloves for good. She hardly ever went out, except to church, or to her husband's grave, and led the life of a nun. It was not till six months later that she took off the weepers and opened the shutters of the windows. She was sometimes seen in the mornings, going with her cook to market for provisions, but what went on in her house and how she lived now could only be surmised. People guessed, from seeing her drinking tea in her garden with the veterinary surgeon, who read the newspaper aloud to her, and from the fact that, meeting a lady she knew at the post-office, she said to her:\n\n\"There is no proper veterinary inspection in our town, and that's the cause of all sorts of epidemics. One is always hearing of people's getting infection from the milk supply, or catching diseases from horses and cows. The health of domestic animals ought to be as well cared for as the health of human beings.\"\n\nShe repeated the veterinary surgeon's words, and was of the same opinion as he about everything. It was evident that she could not live a year without some attachment, and had found new happiness in the lodge. In any one else this would have been censured, but no one could think ill of Olenka; everything she did was so natural. Neither she nor the veterinary surgeon said anything to other people of the change in their relations, and tried, indeed, to conceal it, but without success, for Olenka could not keep a secret. When he had visitors, men serving in his regiment, and she poured out tea or served the supper, she would begin talking of the cattle plague, of the foot and mouth disease, and of the municipal slaughterhouses. He was dreadfully embarrassed, and when the guests had gone, he would seize her by the hand and hiss angrily:\n\n\"I've asked you before not to talk about what you don't understand. When we veterinary surgeons are talking among ourselves, please don't put your word in. It's really annoying.\"\n\nAnd she would look at him with astonishment and dismay, and ask him in alarm: \"But, Voloditchka, what am I to talk about?\"\n\nAnd with tears in her eyes she would embrace him, begging him not to be angry, and they were both happy.\n\nBut this happiness did not last long. The veterinary surgeon departed, departed for ever with his regiment, when it was transferred to a distant place -- to Siberia, it may be. And Olenka was left alone.\n\nNow she was absolutely alone. Her father had long been dead, and his armchair lay in the attic, covered with dust and lame of one leg. She got thinner and plainer, and when people met her in the street they did not look at her as they used to, and did not smile to her; evidently her best years were over and left behind, and now a new sort of life had begun for her, which did not bear thinking about. In the evening Olenka sat in the porch, and heard the band playing and the fireworks popping in the Tivoli, but now the sound stirred no response. She looked into her yard without interest, thought of nothing, wished for nothing, and afterwards, when night came on she went to bed and dreamed of her empty yard. She ate and drank as it were unwillingly.\n\nAnd what was worst of all, she had no opinions of any sort. She saw the objects about her and understood what she saw, but could not form any opinion about them, and did not know what to talk about. And how awful it is not to have any opinions! One sees a bottle, for instance, or the rain, or a peasant driving in his cart, but what the bottle is for, or the rain, or the peasant, and what is the meaning of it, one can't say, and could not even for a thousand roubles. When she had Kukin, or Pustovalov, or the veterinary surgeon, Olenka could explain everything, and give her opinion about anything you like, but now there was the same emptiness in her brain and in her heart as there was in her yard outside. And it was as harsh and as bitter as wormwood in the mouth.\n\nLittle by little the town grew in all directions. The road became a street, and where the Tivoli and the timber-yard had been, there were new turnings and houses. How rapidly time passes! Olenka's house grew dingy, the roof got rusty, the shed sank on one side, and the whole yard was overgrown with docks and stinging-nettles. Olenka herself had grown plain and elderly; in summer she sat in the porch, and her soul, as before, was empty and dreary and full of bitterness. In winter she sat at her window and looked at the snow. When she caught the scent of spring, or heard the chime of the church bells, a sudden rush of memories from the past came over her, there was a tender ache in her heart, and her eyes brimmed over with tears; but this was only for a minute, and then came emptiness again and the sense of the futility of life. The black kitten, Briska, rubbed against her and purred softly, but Olenka was not touched by these feline caresses. That was not what she needed. She wanted a love that would absorb her whole being, her whole soul and reason -- that would give her ideas and an object in life, and would warm her old blood. And she would shake the kitten off her skirt and say with vexation:\n\n\"Get along; I don't want you!\"\n\nAnd so it was, day after day and year after year, and no joy, and no opinions. Whatever Mavra, the cook, said she accepted.\n\nOne hot July day, towards evening, just as the cattle were being driven away, and the whole yard was full of dust, some one suddenly knocked at the gate. Olenka went to open it herself and was dumbfounded when she looked out: she saw Smirnin, the veterinary surgeon, grey-headed, and dressed as a civilian. She suddenly remembered everything. She could not help crying and letting her head fall on his breast without uttering a word, and in the violence of her feeling she did not notice how they both walked into the house and sat down to tea.\n\n\"My dear Vladimir Platonitch! What fate has brought you?\" she muttered, trembling with joy.\n\n\"I want to settle here for good, Olga Semyonovna,\" he told her. \"I have resigned my post, and have come to settle down and try my luck on my own account. Besides, it's time for my boy to go to school. He's a big boy. I am reconciled with my wife, you know.\"\n\n\"Where is she?' asked Olenka.\n\n\"She's at the hotel with the boy, and I'm looking for lodgings.\"\n\n\"Good gracious, my dear soul! Lodgings? Why not have my house? Why shouldn't that suit you? Why, my goodness, I wouldn't take any rent!\" cried Olenka in a flutter, beginning to cry again. \"You live here, and the lodge will do nicely for me. Oh dear! how glad I am!\"\n\nNext day the roof was painted and the walls were whitewashed, and Olenka, with her arms akimbo walked about the yard giving directions. Her face was beaming with her old smile, and she was brisk and alert as though she had waked from a long sleep. The veterinary's wife arrived -- a thin, plain lady, with short hair and a peevish expression. With her was her little Sasha, a boy of ten, small for his age, blue-eyed, chubby, with dimples in his cheeks. And scarcely had the boy walked into the yard when he ran after the cat, and at once there was the sound of his gay, joyous laugh.\n\n\"Is that your puss, auntie?\" he asked Olenka. \"When she has little ones, do give us a kitten. Mamma is awfully afraid of mice.\"\n\nOlenka talked to him, and gave him tea. Her heart warmed and there was a sweet ache in her bosom, as though the boy had been her own child. And when he sat at the table in the evening, going over his lessons, she looked at him with deep tenderness and pity as she murmured to herself:\n\n\"You pretty pet! ... my precious! ... Such a fair little thing, and so clever.\"\n\n\" 'An island is a piece of land which is entirely surrounded by water,' \" he read aloud.\n\n\"An island is a piece of land,\" she repeated, and this was the first opinion to which she gave utterance with positive conviction after so many years of silence and dearth of ideas.\n\nNow she had opinions of her own, and at supper she talked to Sasha's parents, saying how difficult the lessons were at the high schools, but that yet the high school was better than a commercial one, since with a high-school education all careers were open to one, such as being a doctor or an engineer.\n\nSasha began going to the high school. His mother departed to Harkov to her sister's and did not return; his father used to go off every day to inspect cattle, and would often be away from home for three days together, and it seemed to Olenka as though Sasha was entirely abandoned, that he was not wanted at home, that he was being starved, and she carried him off to her lodge and gave him a little room there.\n\nAnd for six months Sasha had lived in the lodge with her. Every morning Olenka came into his bedroom and found him fast asleep, sleeping noiselessly with his hand under his cheek. She was sorry to wake him.\n\n\"Sashenka,\" she would say mournfully, \"get up, darling. It's time for school.\"\n\nHe would get up, dress and say his prayers, and then sit down to breakfast, drink three glasses of tea, and eat two large cracknels and a half a buttered roll. All this time he was hardly awake and a little ill-humoured in consequence.\n\n\"You don't quite know your fable, Sashenka,\" Olenka would say, looking at him as though he were about to set off on a long journey. \"What a lot of trouble I have with you! You must work and do your best, darling, and obey your teachers.\"\n\n\"Oh, do leave me alone!\" Sasha would say.\n\nThen he would go down the street to school, a little figure, wearing a big cap and carrying a satchel on his shoulder. Olenka would follow him noiselessly."

    "rubric": "The short story \"The Darling\" by Anton Chekhov is about a woman named Olenka, who seems to lose herself in the lives of the men she loves. Olenka is sweet and affectionate, but she doesn’t really have her own opinions or interests. Instead, she adopts the views and passions of whoever she’s with at the time. First, she marries Kukin, a theater manager, and becomes deeply invested in his work, talking about the struggles of the theater as if they were her own. When Kukin dies, she quickly moves on and marries Pustovalov, a timber merchant, and suddenly her world revolves around the timber business.\n\nAfter Pustovalov passes away, Olenka finds herself alone and without direction. She briefly forms a connection with Smirnin, a veterinary surgeon, and takes on his concerns about animal health as her own. But when he leaves, Olenka is left adrift again, with no one to guide her thoughts or give her life purpose. It’s only when Smirnin returns years later with his young son, Sasha, that Olenka finds a new sense of fulfillment. She pours all her love and attention into caring for Sasha, almost obsessively, as if she’s found a new anchor for her identity.\n\nThe story paints a bittersweet picture of Olenka’s life. While she’s kind and loving, her complete dependence on others for her sense of self leaves her vulnerable and empty when she’s alone. Chekhov seems to be exploring themes of identity, love, and the human need for connection, all wrapped up in Olenka’s tender but somewhat tragic story.",

      "\"The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings—by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein’s work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody.\n\nThat Lichtenstein’s images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren’t quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein’s work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it.\n\nBut if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein’s work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein’s work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naiveté, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics—typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.\"\n\nCan you summarize the above passage? I'm trying to explain about Lichtenstein to someone who's not interested in art, so make the summary 5 to 7 sentences long. Make sure it's easy to understand while keeping the key points. "

      "Create a summary of the following poem:\n\n\"Let us go then, you and I,\nWhen the evening is spread out against the sky\nLike a patient etherized upon a table;\nLet us go, through certain half-deserted streets,\nThe muttering retreats\nOf restless nights in one-night cheap hotels\nAnd sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:\nStreets that follow like a tedious argument\nOf insidious intent\nTo lead you to an overwhelming question ...\n\nOh, do not ask, “What is it?”\nLet us go and make our visit.\n\nIn the room the women come and go\nTalking of Michelangelo.\n\nThe yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,\nThe yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes,\nLicked its tongue into the corners of the evening,\nLingered upon the pools that stand in drains,\nLet fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,\nSlipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,\nAnd seeing that it was a soft October night,\nCurled once about the house, and fell asleep.\n\nAnd indeed there will be time\nFor the yellow smoke that slides along the street,\nRubbing its back upon the window-panes;\nThere will be time, there will be time\nTo prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;\nThere will be time to murder and create,\nAnd time for all the works and days of hands\nThat lift and drop a question on your plate;\nTime for you and time for me,\nAnd time yet for a hundred indecisions,\nAnd for a hundred visions and revisions,\nBefore the taking of a toast and tea.\n\nIn the room the women come and go\nTalking of Michelangelo.\n\nAnd indeed there will be time\nTo wonder, “Do I dare?” and, “Do I dare?”\nTime to turn back and descend the stair,\nWith a bald spot in the middle of my hair —\n(They will say: “How his hair is growing thin!”)\nMy morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,\nMy necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin —\n(They will say: “But how his arms and legs are thin!”)\nDo I dare\nDisturb the universe?\nIn a minute there is time\nFor decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.\n\nFor I have known them all already, known them all:\nHave known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,\nI have measured out my life with coffee spoons;\nI know the voices dying with a dying fall\nBeneath the music from a farther room.\n               So how should I presume?\n\nAnd I have known the eyes already, known them all—\nThe eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,\nAnd when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,\nWhen I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,\nThen how should I begin\nTo spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?\n               And how should I presume?\n\nAnd I have known the arms already, known them all—\nArms that are braceleted and white and bare\n(But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!)\nIs it perfume from a dress\nThat makes me so digress?\nArms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.\n               And should I then presume?\n               And how should I begin?\n\nShall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets\nAnd watched the smoke that rises from the pipes\nOf lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows? ...\n\nI should have been a pair of ragged claws\nScuttling across the floors of silent seas.\n\nAnd the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!\nSmoothed by long fingers,\nAsleep ... tired ... or it malingers,\nStretched on the floor, here beside you and me.\nShould I, after tea and cakes and ices,\nHave the strength to force the moment to its crisis?\nBut though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,\nThough I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,\nI am no prophet — and here’s no great matter;\nI have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,\nAnd I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,\nAnd in short, I was afraid.\n\nAnd would it have been worth it, after all,\nAfter the cups, the marmalade, the tea,\nAmong the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,\nWould it have been worth while,\nTo have bitten off the matter with a smile,\nTo have squeezed the universe into a ball\nTo roll it towards some overwhelming question,\nTo say: “I am Lazarus, come from the dead,\nCome back to tell you all, I shall tell you all”—\nIf one, settling a pillow by her head\n               Should say: “That is not what I meant at all;\n               That is not it, at all.”\n\nAnd would it have been worth it, after all,\nWould it have been worth while,\nAfter the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,\nAfter the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor—\nAnd this, and so much more?—\nIt is impossible to say just what I mean!\nBut as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:\nWould it have been worth while\nIf one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,\nAnd turning toward the window, should say:\n               “That is not it at all,\n               That is not what I meant, at all.”\n\nNo! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;\nAm an attendant lord, one that will do\nTo swell a progress, start a scene or two,\nAdvise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,\nDeferential, glad to be of use,\nPolitic, cautious, and meticulous;\nFull of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;\nAt times, indeed, almost ridiculous—\nAlmost, at times, the Fool.\n\nI grow old ... I grow old ...\nI shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.\n\nShall I part my hair behind?   Do I dare to eat a peach?\nI shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.\nI have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.\n\nI do not think that they will sing to me.\n\nI have seen them riding seaward on the waves\nCombing the white hair of the waves blown back\nWhen the wind blows the water white and black.\nWe have lingered in the chambers of the sea\nBy sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown\nTill human voices wake us, and we drown.\"\n\nLimit the summary to less than 200 words.

      "Could you summarise each of the album reviews given in this provided text into two sentences? Which outlines how the album was generally received by audiences.\n'Oxfordshire teenagers Colin and Jonny Greenwood, Ed O’Brien, Philip Selway, and Thom Yorke called themselves On a Friday when they first formed a band in 1985. Signing to EMI in the early ‘90s, the quintet rebranded at the label’s request, naming itself after the Talking Heads deep cut “Radio Head.” The grungy 1993 outcast anthem “Creep” remains its most recognizable single, but Radiohead subsequently established itself as perhaps the most revered album act of its generation.\n\nIn a series of increasingly abstract and unpredictable albums with co-producer Nigel Godrich, Radiohead somehow became critical darlings and more commercially successful than ever, despite often eschewing guitars and radio singles. Borrowing glitchy textures and icy minimalism from electronic music and instrumentation from jazz and the avant-garde side of the classical world, Radiohead constantly challenged its audience. Through it all, however, Yorke’s gorgeous voice and poignant, sometimes darkly funny way of looking at the world remain a connecting thread in Radiohead’s catalog.\n\nRadiohead’s sixth album Hail to the Thief is 20 years old today. In a recent SPIN interview, Selway indicated that Radiohead will reconvene at some point this year to “start looking at ideas for what comes next.” With a potential 10th album in the works, we decided to rank the nine albums the band has released so far.\n\n9. The King of Limbs (2011)\n \n\n\nAlso Read\nThom Yorke Offers New, Rare Songs At New Zealand Solo Tour Kickoff\nPlay\nAt 37 minutes, The King of Limbs is Radiohead’s shortest album. Though Yorke’s dancing in the “Lotus Flower” video spawned unlikely internet memes, the album’s fidgety rhythms and drily minimalist arrangements ultimately proved hard to love even for fans who’d followed Radiohead through every previous reinvention. Indeed, when music critics anointed 2011’s best albums, Radiohead largely ceded its perennial place on most year-end lists to newer acts such as Bon Iver and St. Vincent. Several acclaimed non-album tracks released later in 2011, including “The Daily Mail” and “Supercollider,” drove home the sense that The King of Limbs probably could have been better. Still, it contains moments of arresting beauty that shouldn’t be dismissed, particularly the acoustic “Give Up the Ghost.” “Listen to it enough times and you may convince yourself you love it. But let’s not kid ourselves that it’s up there with their best work. It just isn’t,” wrote Rebecca Schiller in the NME review.\n\nBuy The King of Limbs on Amazon\n\n8. Pablo Honey (1993)\n \n\nPlay\nIn 1993, Radiohead was just another Pixies-loving British band who happened to have an amazing lead singer, and three guitarists with enough noisy tricks up their sleeves to fit in with an alternative radio landscape dominated by American grunge bands. The thing that’s aged most poorly about Pablo Honey is its title, inspired by a Jerky Boys prank call skit, but the music here is a little better than it tends to get credit for. The band was already toying with unusual time signatures on the lurching, pseudo-waltz of opener “You,” while “I Can’t” and “Ripcord” feature the kind of soaring choruses the band would master on its next album, The Bends. “Creep” has a complicated legacy within the Radiohead catalog, but it has more or less remained in the band’s live repertoire for decades (unlike every other song on the album), and that chorus still rips. “The English quintet’s debut doesn’t really deliver anything you haven’t heard before, steering too close to Smiths-like melodies and trying ever so hard to be depressed in the way the Cure popularized,” wrote Mario Mundoz in the Los Angeles Times.\n\nBuy Pablo Honey on Amazon\n\n7. Hail to the Thief (2003)\n \n\nPlay\nFor those who miss the six-string acrobatics and live interplay of ‘90s Radiohead, Hail to the Thief is the 21st century album that most heavily features the full quintet playing together in a room. Drum machines and Jonny Greenwood’s beloved ondes Martenot electronic music instrument make appearances, but the joy of making a racket with drums and guitars courses through the album. Despite some undeniably great songs like “There There” and “Where I End and You Begin,” however, the 14-song collection can feel long-winded and at times exhausting. Hail to the Thief has received some of its harshest criticism from the band itself, and in 2008 Yorke posted a resequenced tracklist on the band’s website that dropped four songs from his revised vision of the album. “It feels more like a band playing to a multitude of strengths than the formal wrestling of Kid A,” Will Hermes wrote in the SPIN review of the album.\n\nBuy Hail to the Thief on Amazon\n\n6. A Moon Shaped Pool (2016)\n \n\nPlay\nRadiohead has always been seen as a serious artistic entity that meticulously crafts and sequences its albums with vision and care. So it came as a mild shock to realize that the band simply put the songs on A Moon Shaped Pool in alphabetical order – even more astonishing, it actually flows pretty well. Radiohead’s most recent album, nearly seven years old now, contains some of its most ambitious string arrangements to date on “The Numbers” and “Glass Eyes,” with Greenwood deftly drawing on his experience scoring Paul Thomas Anderson films with the London Contemporary Orchestra. It concludes with the first official studio release of “True Love Waits,” a legendary song that the band first performed live in 1995 and attempted to record many times over two decades, finally settling on a piano-based arrangement for A Moon Shaped Pool. “Throughout the album, Yorke’s everyday enlightenment is backed by music of expanse and abandon. The guitars sound like pianos, the pianos sound like guitars, and the mixes breathe with pastoral calm,” Jayson Greene wrote in the Pitchfork review of the album.\n\nBuy A Moon Shaped Pool on Amazon\n\n5. Amnesiac (2001)\n \n\nPlay\nPart of the mystique of Kid A’s arrival in 2000 was the promise of a companion album to come the following year. Many speculated that Radiohead had saved more conventional rock songs for the follow-up, at least until the band began previewing meditative, piano-driven material like “You and Whose Army?” and “Pyramid Song” in concert. Amnesiac ultimately did contain some great guitar-driven songs such as “I Might Be Wrong” and “Knives Out,” which is of course the only Radiohead song with a series of hit mystery films named after it. But the album is largely just as ascetic and elliptical as its predecessor, from the glitchy minimalism of “Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box” to the reverse tape effects of “Like Spinning Plates.” “Amnesiac strikes a cunning and rewarding balance between experimentation and quality control. It’s hardly easy to digest but nor is it impossible to swallow,” wrote Alex Petridis in The Guardian’s review of the album.\n\nBuy Amnesiac on Amazon\n\n4. In Rainbows (2007)\n \n\nPlay\nBy 2007, the Napster-era disruption of the music industry was in full swing, traditional physical sales were on a sharp decline, and iTunes was king. Radiohead, which had completed its EMI contract and was a big-name free agent for the first time, declined to sign a new label contract and decided to go for a big gesture. In October, one of the most popular bands in the world announced it was self-releasing a new album in a week, with no advance singles or videos, via its website as a pay-what-you-want download. After the dust settled and the unorthodox rollout shook up the industry, the music on In Rainbows became its real legacy. “15 Steps” and “Reckoner” tumble and pop with adventurous new approaches to rhythm and percussion, and the simmering “Weird Fishes/Arpeggi” has emerged over the past decade as the band’s most popular 21st century track. “There are even moments of near-romanticism, a strange injection for a band that’s examined clinical emotional distance so well. ‘All I Need’ uses an ‘80s synth vibe to explore love’s dreadful side, and ‘House of Cards’ gets almost sexy,” wrote Josh Modell in the AV Club review of the album.\n\nBuy In Rainbows on Amazon\n\n3. The Bends (1995)\n \n\nPlay\nYou really had to be there. Indeed, it was a revelation that the band that made “Creep” was capable of opening an album with a song like “Planet Telex,” its atmospheric whooshes ushering in a drum loop and processed piano. From the swaggering “Just” to the haunting “Street Spirit (Fade Out),” The Bends is Radiohead’s influential peak as a guitar band. It may not be the reason Radiohead can fill arenas today, but it probably is, more indirectly, the reason Coldplay and Muse can. The Radiohead aesthetic as we know it truly starts to take shape on The Bends, the first album to feature contributions from cover art designer Stanley Donwood and producer Nigel Godrich. The album solidified the band’s commercial standing in the U.K., but in America, The Bends was a sleeper hit that was initially dismissed by most print critics. “Radiohead’s overwrought, pompous music makes them sound like alternative rock’s answer to the Moody Blues,” Kevin McKeough wrote in the Chicago Tribune.\n\nBuy The Bends on Amazon\n\n2. Kid A (2000)\n \n\nPlay\nIn retrospect, it’s quaint how little Radiohead really had to depart from the alternative rock status quo to thrill and scandalize a generation of music listeners. The horns cutting loose over a rumbling bassline on “The National Anthem,” the entrancing 5/4 electric piano riff on “Everything in Its Right Place,” and the propulsive dance beat on “Idioteque” all offer sturdy, tangible hooks and riffs. But the most revered rock band in the world releasing an album without recognizable guitars until its fourth song was treated as a provocation that repelled as many as it attracted. Even Selway waiting until halfway through “Optimistic” to strike a snare drum feels like a moment of carefully calibrated restraint. The confidence with which Radiohead and Godrich leaned into those choices, creating minutely detailed ear candy that reveals new textures with every listen, made Kid A a compelling and charismatic event album even as it swung away from the pop zeitgeist. “Much of Kid A doesn’t sound like Radiohead at all. Songs float by on the faintest of heartbeat pulses, intergalactic noises streaking like comets across the melodies. Ecclesiastical keyboards gently nudge the songs along,” David Browne wrote in the Entertainment Weekly review.\n\nBuy Kid A on Amazon\n\n1. OK Computer (1997)\n \n\nPlay\nBy the mid-‘90s, alternative rock had become pop music, and Radiohead spent a stretch of 1995 and 1996 on two of the biggest tours of the era, opening for R.E.M. in support of Monster and Alanis Morissette in support of Jagged Little Pill. Then the band went home and recorded a challenging and ambitious album that surely wouldn’t sell as well as The Bends, shelving some accessible songs like “Lift” and “True Love Waits” in favor of multi-faceted material like the six-minute lead single “Paranoid Android.” Instead, OK Computer was a global hit and became one of the most acclaimed albums of the decade, capturing all the beauty of Yorke’s voice with arrestingly unpredictable arrangements and eerie textures that didn’t sound like they could’ve been conjured out of guitars and keyboards. The robots, aliens, and dystopian karma police populating the songs moved many critics to place Radiohead in the pantheon of British concept album kings like Pink Floyd and David Bowie. OK Computer, however, isn’t a rock opera so much as a mood board of the kind of new sensations and familiar emotions that would shape rock songwriting in the oncoming digital age. “OK Computer is a high-wire act without a net. There is no obvious single, the lyrics don’t make immediate sense, most of the tracks are too slow, distorted, or weird for radio, and the whole thing sounds like nothing that sells. Yet this U.K. quintet’s audacious sonic sprawl is the most appealingly odd effort by a name rock band in ages,” wrote Barry Walters in the SPIN review."

So it's easier to follow, arrange the summary in the form of a bulleted list. Make sure to include the names of anyone important in the article along with what makes them important. Here is the text: Iceland is considering building a new space for its National Gallery to boost the profile of Icelandic art history and provide appropriate conditions for its collections after a report highlighted serious deficiencies in the museum’s existing spaces.\n\nThe national gallery, home to around 16,000 works, mostly from the 19th and 20th centuries, is currently housed across three locations in the capital of Reykjavik. These comprise a main site at Fríkirkjuveg, opposite the picturesque Tjörnin Lake in the city centre; the recently opened House of Collections; and the home and studio of the painter Ásgrímur Jónsson, open by appointment.\n\nThe culture minister, Lilja Alfreðsdóttir, published a new policy paper in May 2023 calling for a flourishing art sector that gains prominence locally and internationally. The policy paper’s action plan established a working group of independent experts to assess the national gallery and “form a future vision for the development of a world-class national gallery”.\n\nThe report, submitted in April, found several key areas where the museum was not fulfilling its mission. The site’s buildings were found particularly wanting.\n\n“The exhibition spaces in the main building have significant limitations”, while the “hidden away” entrance of the main museum undersells the site, Mikkel Bogh, the former director of Copenhagen’s Statens Museum for Kunst (SMK), wrote in the report. In addition, he said, “The conditions for storage and conservation work are downright alarming from a museum professional’s perspective”. A leak in one of the main storage rooms meant that gallery staff recently had to move part of the collection of works on paper before a storm to avoid damage, according to Ingibjörg Jóhannsdóttir, the museum’s director.\n\nWithout suitable space to show, store and research art, the gallery has been unable to conserve or display some of the nation’s most important works. As a result, Jóhannsdóttir says, “the story of Icelandic art history has not been told.”\n\nThe Fríkirkjuveg location recently underwent renovation, but the gallery’s two main sites comprise only around 2,000 sq. m of “exhibition and media” space. The report found that around 4,500 to 5,800 sq. m is needed, and another 6,000 sq. m for storage and research.\n\nArchitectural competition\nSeveral solutions are proposed, from expanding the current Fríkirkjuveg site to creating an entirely new space elsewhere in the city – perhaps close to Reykjavik’s impressive Harpa concert hall, built in 2011.\n\n“I have a dream that we have built a visual arts museum that is located at the bay, by the Harpa music centre, and that you could cycle or walk between them,” says Alfreðsdóttir, the culture minister.\n\nThe cost of a new site is estimated at 15bn Icelandic krona (around $108m), a sum Alfreðsdóttir thinks is achievable. “Iceland is one of these countries that has abundant resources, whether it’s energy, fish, and we are a very popular destination, so we’re going to see growth of around 2%-5% in the next 20 years,” she says. The creative industries receive around 1.3% of the nation’s GDP in public funding, her ministry says, among the highest share in Europe. She hopes she can launch an architectural competition for an entirely new site before her term ends in autumn 2025.\n\nJóhannsdóttir says she would like to at least have a “clear plan forward” in the next two years, and for a new storage space to be available within that window. “I can just see it in my mind, how beautiful it would be to see the different dialogues we could make. There are just some incredible works that we’d love to have on display all the time.”\n"

Furthermore, keep the summary to two paragraphs. Afterwards, in a section titled \"Discussion,\" offer your objective thoughts on the piece and give it a letter grade (A-F). Thank you!\n\n\nFrankenstein: The Luftmensch of La Mancha\nFrom his childhood, Victor Frankenstein ardently “desire[s] to divine … the secrets of heaven and earth” (Shelley, 35-36). These starry-eyed aspirations make him view “the dreams of forgotten alchemists” as suitably majestic and noble pursuits but see modern natural philosophy as obsessed with “realities of little worth” (46). When he arrives at university, his beliefs are only confirmed by the tedium of academic science and its obsession with the mundane. But this tedium also holds “realities” within it, something his occult alchemy lacks (46). Realizing this, he seeks to combine the two disciplines and “pioneer a new way” to replace academia’s banal natural philosophy with something comparable to the quixotism of Agrippic alchemy (48). Victor’s youthful ambitions cling to his, causing him to fashion his monster, and thus making his seemingly innocent childhood readings the ultimate reason for his creature’s creation and responsible for the destruction it wreaks.\nFrankenstein’s “contempt for … natural philosophy” derives from his youth (46). His “remarkably secluded” childhood allows him to explore the bygone “steps of knowledge” and “exchange[] the discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists” in his books of alchemy and magic (44-45, 46, 46). Thus, when he reaches the university, how can the monotonous classifying and cataloging of modern science possibly satisfy him? These “realities of little worth” cannot rival the “chimeras of boundless grandeur” sought by the “masters of science” in his books (46).\nThe ambitious dreams that alchemy’s romanticism spawned in Victor’s youth never fully relinquish him and lead him to fantastical aspirations in adulthood. Instead of appreciating that modern philosophers can “penetrate into the recesses of nature and show how she works in her hiding-places,” he simply sees that they do not seek “immortality and power” like the alchemists in his books, and thus cannot be as “grand” as he wishes (47, 46, 46). He is aware of alchemy’s ridiculous, recondite goals: he admits that the senescent discipline’s objectives are “futile” (46). Yet he pursues them anyway, displaying his unwavering ambitions. He irrationally believes that he will be the first to accomplish these goals chased for generations. In his mind, he, Victor Frankenstein, can do it; he can succeed where others have failed.\nAcademia’s humble goals are incomparable to the lofty dreams of the alchemists of old. Thus, when his school “require[s]” that he only study natural philosophy, and that he leave his dreams behind, Victor cannot be more disdainful (46). He feels as though they are not focused on “discoveries,” but on “annihilate[ing the] visions on which [his] interest in science [is] chiefly founded” (46). While partially realizing his mistake after M. Waldman’s heartfelt “panegyric” on natural philosophy, his early inculcation into alchemy does not relinquish him (47). His arrogance precludes him from making the exchange the academic community “require[s]” and he simply clings tighter to his ambitions (46). Nevertheless, he does comprehend the “chimer[ical]” nature of alchemy, and accordingly combines the two fields, harnessing the idealism in his books and the realism of his school to triumph over nature (46).\nFrankenstein, like the alchemists before him, has “grand” visions (46). But unlike them he can now realize these fantasies with modern natural philosophy and “pioneer a new way” (48). Undeterred by the academic community’s reception of his ideas and still straining for his childhood reveries, Victor creates his monster. When he refuses to “exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth,” he makes “chimeras … realities” (46). The comparison between the Greek beast and Frankenstein’s creature is clear. It too is a monster, a potpourri of parts that cannot be controlled and ravages the world.\nVictor’s early alchemic indoctrination clings to him like a bur to a sock, fixed deep within and irradicable. When he is confronted by academia’s contempt for alchemy, the hooked thorns only sink deeper in, engendering not only bitterness towards their aims, but also further embedding his own ideals. Nevertheless, this bur is not blinding: Victor realizes the obsolescence of alchemy’s methods and thus combines it with natural philosophy, propelled by alchemy’s idealism and academia’s realism. He achieves what none thought possible. Yet, this is not a positive thing. His youthfully-implanted quixotism effects something slightly more harmful than fighting windmills. It is his Rocinante, and it carries him to the creation of his “chimera” (46). Unfortunately, Bellerophon could not slay it this time."

      "Authors of the NSC&FFP survey (1993) developed a comprehensive\nlist comprised of 28 stated reasons for becoming a\nfoster parent derived from previous research on motivation for\nfostering. The survey asked foster parents to endorse reasons\nfor fostering by indicating “yes” or “no” if a reason described\nwhy they wanted to foster.\nInitial analysis of the NSC&FFP data (DHHS, 1993) reported\nthat parents had multiple reasons for being foster parents.\nMost respondents wanted to provide a child with love and\nwith a good home. Two-thirds of parents indicated that they\nwanted to provide a home for a child who would otherwise be\nin an institution and because they wanted to help children with\nspecial problems. Over half of parents believed fostering was\na way to do something for their communities. Approximately\none-fourth of parents gave one or more reasons related to parenting\na child, such as being unable to have children, wanting\na larger family, wanting to adopt, or wanting to parent after\ntheir children were grown. Parents licensed after 1985 were\nmore likely to foster because they knew a child and because\nthey were interested in adoption, than those approved earlier,\nreflecting increased emphasis on kinship care and permanency\nplanning.\nThe NSC&FFP survey and other studies yielded fairly\nconsistent descriptions about reasons for fostering (Anderson,\n2001; Baum, Crase, & Crase, 2001; Kirton, 2001). Several studies\nexamined how reasons for fostering related to placement\noutcomes for children. Kraus (1971) and Hampson and\nTavormina (1980) found positive relationships between\nchild-centered reasons for fostering and placement duration.\nPlacement disruptions were more frequent in families motivated\nby wanting companionship for their children (Kraus, 1971).\nFoster parents motivated by altruism, being childless, and\n109\nidentifying with the child received high performance ratings\nfrom foster care workers while those motivated by wanting\nto look after children were rated as barely adequate (Dando &\nMinty, 1987).\nTwo studies considered how reasons for fostering related to\nretention. Triseliotis, Borland, and Hill (1998) found no differences\nbetween reasons for fostering and continuation, except\nfor families who started fostering as an avenue to adoption.\nRindfleisch, Denby, and Bean’s (1998) study of closed and open\nfoster homes found that wanting to adopt and not being able\nto do so increased the likelihood that a foster home closed.\nNone of the aforementioned studies address how reasons\nfor fostering relate to foster parents’ activity levels as service\nproviders. The present study uses data from the NSC&FFP to\nextend understanding of utilization by examining how reasons\nfor fostering are associated with foster family utilization. It\nlimits the analysis to non-kinship foster families because nationally\nthis is the most prevalent type of foster care, because\nthe vast majority of caregivers sampled by the NSC&FFP were\nnon-kinship foster families, and because kin and non-kin families\nhave different reasons for fostering (Le Prohn, 1994). Also,\nit will use both inferential and descriptive statistics. Principal\nresearch questions include what reasons for fostering are associated\nwith:\n•the total number of the number of children fostered,\nwhether or not any foster children were placed in the\nhome at the time of the survey, and the number of\nchildren in the foster home at the time of the survey?\n•licensing capacity?\n•the number of types of special needs children\nfostered and if parents foster children from more than\none racial group?\n•whether or not respondents adopted children and\nadopted foster children?\n•retention as evidenced by the number of years\nfostered and the intention to continue fostering?\nMethods\nReasons for Fostering\n110 Journal of Sociology & Social Welfare\nThe NSC&FFP was conducted in 1991, and it is the only\nstudy of current and former foster families based on a national\nprobability sample (DHHS, 1993). The purpose of the\nNSC&FFP was to collect extensive information potentially\nuseful in agency and public policy planning regarding recruitment\nand retention of foster parents. This rich data set provides\nan opportunity to examine these and other important\nissues concerning family foster care.\nThe NSC&FFP used a multistage stratified sampling design\nwith probability sampling at each stage so that the findings\ngeneralize to the 1991 U. S. population of approved, licensed,\nor certified foster families. States were stratified by level of\nfoster care payment. Counties were stratified by residence and\nby level of unemployment. Foster parents were stratified by\ntheir current and former status. Current foster parents were\nstratified by their length of service. Ultimately, data were collected\nfrom foster parents living in 27 counties in 9 states. The\nunweighted sample contains 1048 current (116,964 weighted)\nand 265 former foster families (63,823 weighted).\nOnly data from current foster families were used in the\npresent study because the full range of foster home utilization\nmeasures used in this study were collected only from current\nfoster families. Also, families approved to provide kinship care,\ngroup care, or unspecified “other” types of foster care were excluded.\nOf the total sample of 1048 current foster families, 876\nfamilies (108,592 weighted) met these criteria.\nThe population-weighted sample was used in order to\nobtain representative national estimates. Estimates were computed\nusing the Jackknife (JK1) replication approach. The replicate\nand full sample weights were used in the analyses. Data\nwere analyzed using WesVar (Version 4.0, SPSS 2001). WesVar\nPC is used to analyze data collected using complex sampling\ndesigns such as the NSC&FFP (Johnson & Elliott, 1998).\nFor descriptive purposes, family-level characteristics\ninclude income, marital status, number of children, whether\nthey adopted children, geographic location, and number of\nyears fostering. Individual-level characteristics include race,\nage, educational level, and employment status.\nRespondents were asked to indicate why they wanted to be\nfoster parents by checking “yes” or “no” to a list of 28 reasons.\nIn addition, a count variable was created for the total number\n111\nof endorsed reasons for fostering, and this variable has a potential\nrange of values from 0 through 28.\nRespondents were asked whether they had fostered the\nfollowing types of special needs children: (1) developmentally\ndisabled/mentally retarded child, (2) physically handicapped\nor seriously ill child, (3) drug-exposed infant or newborn,\n(4) child born with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or other alcoholrelated\ndisorders, (5) child born with AIDS virus, (6) mentally\nill or emotionally or behaviorally disturbed child, or (7) sexually\nabused child. A variable for each type of special needs child\nwas coded 0 for “have not fostered” and 1 for “have fostered.”\nA count variable was created for the total number of the types\nof special needs children respondents had fostered, and this\nvariable has a potential range of values from 0 through 7.\nAnother measure of foster family utilization used was\nwhether a family fostered children from multiple racial\ngroups. Respondents to the NSC&FFP also were asked if they\nhad fostered children with the following identified racial backgrounds:\n(1) American Indian or Alaskan Native; (2) Asian or\nPacific Islander; (3) Black, not of Hispanic origin; (4) Hispanic\n(including Mexican American); (5) White, not of Hispanic\norigin; and (6) “Other.” A dichotomous variable was coded\n0 for “fostered from one race group” and 1 for “fostered from\nmultiple racial groups.”\nRetention was considered as a utilization variable because\nfoster parents have to remain licensed in order to provide\nplacements for children. Indicators of retention included the\nnumber of years as a foster parent and if they planned to continue\nfostering. Respondents were asked what year they were\napproved to foster. Because data were collected in 1991, number\nof years fostered was calculated by subtracting the year of approval\nfrom 1991. An expressed intention to continue fostering\nwas used as an indicator of foster home utilization since foster\nfamilies who discontinue fostering can no longer accept foster\ncare placements. Respondents were asked if over the next three\nyears they intended to continue to foster. A response of “yes”\nwas coded 1 and “no” was coded 0.\nResults\nReasons for Fostering\n112 Journal of Sociology & Social Welfare\nDescriptive statistics appropriate to the level of measurement\nand distributional characteristics of the variables are reported\n(e.g., medians are reported for skewed distributions).\nBivariate linear regression was used to analyze quantitative dependent\nvariables, and R2 is reported to quantify the strength\nof these relationships. Bivariate binary logistic regression was\nused to analyze dichotomous dependent variables, and odds\nratios (OR) are reported to quantify the strength of these relationships.\nIn all analyses two-tailed tests were used with a .05\nlevel of statistical significance.\nThe majority of information in the present study was provided\nby foster mothers (65%) or jointly by foster mothers\nand foster fathers (28%). Foster fathers (7%) provided a small\npercentage.\nAs shown in Table 1, three-fourths of families included\nmarried couples or couples living as married couples. Income\nlevels were fairly diverse, with 42% of families with incomes\nless than $25,000, 32% with incomes from $25,000 to $39,999,\nand 26% with incomes of $40,000 or greater. Seventy-seven\npercent of families had at least one birth child. Thirty percent\nof families had adopted children and 22% of families adopted\nfoster children. Approximately 40% of families lived in suburban\nareas, 36% in urban areas, and 24% in rural areas. Foster\nfamilies on average had 6.6 years of fostering experience (SD =\n6.4) with a median of 4 years.\nTable 2 shows the demographic characteristics of foster\nmothers and fathers. Racial diversity was found, with 29%\nof foster mothers and 22% of foster fathers being minorities.\nSpecifically, 22% of mothers and 13% of fathers were African-\nAmerican. In terms of education, 84% of mothers and 86% of\nfathers had at least a high school education. Seventeen percent\nof mothers and 23% of fathers had a bachelor’s degree or\nhigher. Most (83%) fathers were employed full-time, whereas\nonly 35% of mothers were employed full-time. Forty-eight\npercent of foster mothers were not employed outside of the\nhome. The mean age of mothers was 44.2 years (SD = 10.6) and\nthe mean age of fathers was 45.1 years (SD = 11.0).\n\n--\n\nCan you summarize this in under 300 words using a mix of short (3 or fewer sentences) paragraphs and bulleted lists? Include a couple of the most important stats mentioned. Number the paragraphs but not any lists. There was something about retention in the text. Include a sentence about that in the summary and italicize it so I can easily notice it. Don't mention any demographic information based on a protected class.

It was beyond anything we had expected to find in Egypt.\" The animal—which is native to sub-Saharan Africa—was caught and killed by local people in Wadi Yahmib, some 19 miles from the Egypt–Sudan border. This is roughly 310 miles north of the known range of spotted hyenas in Sudan, with the researchers speculating that a rare weather phenomena opened up a migration corridor that allowed the predator to go beyond its usual hunting grounds. The Active Red Sea Trough is a rare tongue of low-pressure that extends up the Red Sea from the south when easterly winds blow over the adjacent mountains, and it is known to cause extreme rainfall and flash flooding. Nagy and his colleagues believe that a once-a-decade weather cycle that is linked to the Active Red Sea Trough has been causing more rain over the Egypt–Sudan border. This, in turn, increased plant growth, forging a migration corridor along which it traveled seeking grazing animals on which to prey. Analysis of historical satellite images of the region confirmed that the area of the corridor has seen higher levels of plant growth in the last five years, potentially enough to support prey for a curious hyena on the prowl. \"The fact that the corridor area has become less environmentally harsh, offering easier passage along 'the highway,' may explain how the hyena reached this far north,\" Nagy said. \"However, the motivation for its extensive journey into Egypt is still a mystery that demands further research,\" he added. Pack predators found in various different habitats across sub-Saharan Africa, spotted hyenas are known to travel up to 17 miles in day, often shadowing human-managed livestock migrations. (In fact, the animal in question was tracked and killed after it killed two goats herded by locals within the Elba Protected Area, a national park.) The findings, the team conclude, both challenge our assumptions about the known ranges of spotted hyenas but also highlight how regional climate changes can shift animal migrations.\""

      "Can you summarize the following information about starlings for me?

Don't use any lists in your summary, all the information should be given in standard paragraph format. Make it 4 paragraphs long, and each paragraph must include no more than 4 sentences. Try to give it an enthusiastic and exciting feel to maintain their interest.\n\n[Text:]\nStarlings are small to medium-sized passerine birds in the family Sturnidae, common name of Sturnid. The Sturnidae are named for the genus Sturnus, which in turn comes from the Latin word for starling, sturnus. The family contains 128 species which are divided into 36 genera. Many Asian species, particularly the larger ones, are called mynas, and many African species are known as glossy starlings because of their iridescent plumage. Starlings are native to Europe, Asia, and Africa, as well as northern Australia and the islands of the tropical Pacific. Several European and Asian species have been introduced to these areas, as well as North America, Hawaii, and New Zealand, where they generally compete for habitats with native birds and are considered to be invasive species. The starling species familiar to most people in Europe and North America is the common starling, and throughout much of Asia and the Pacific, the common myna is indeed common.\n\nStarlings have strong feet, their flight is strong and direct, and they are very gregarious. Their preferred habitat is fairly open country, and they eat insects and fruit. Several species live around human habitation and are effectively omnivores. Many species search for prey such as grubs by \"open-bill probing\", that is, forcefully opening the bill after inserting it into a crevice, thus expanding the hole and exposing the prey; this behaviour is referred to by the German verb zirkeln (pronounced [ˈtsɪʁkl̩n]).[1]\n\nPlumage of many species is typically dark with a metallic sheen. Most species nest in holes and lay blue or white eggs.\n\nStarlings have diverse and complex vocalizations and have been known to embed sounds from their surroundings into their own calls, including car alarms and human speech patterns. The birds can recognize particular individuals by their calls and are the subject of research into the evolution of human language.[2]\n\nDescription\nThe common starling (Sturnus vulgaris) has iridescent plumage.\nStarlings are medium-sized passerines.[3] The shortest-bodied species is Kenrick's starling (Poeoptera kenricki), at 15 cm (6 in), but the lightest-weight species is Abbott's starling (Poeoptera femoralis), which is 34 g (1+1⁄4 oz). The largest starling, going on standard measurements and perhaps weight, is the Nias hill myna (Gracula robusta). This species can measure up to 36 cm (14 in), and in domestication they can weigh up to 400 g (14 oz). Rivaling the prior species in bulk if not dimensions, the mynas of the genus Mino are also large, especially the yellow-faced (M. dumontii) and long-tailed mynas (M. kreffti). The longest species in the family is the white-necked myna (Streptocitta albicollis), which can measure up to 50 cm (19+1⁄2 in), although around 60% in this magpie-like species is comprised by its very long tail.[4]\n\nLess sexual dimorphism is seen in plumage, but with only 25 species showing such differences between the two sexes. The plumage of the starling is often brightly coloured due to iridescence; this colour is derived from the structure of the feathers, not from any pigment. Some species of Asian starling have crests or erectile feathers on the crest. Other ornamentation includes elongated tail feathers and brightly coloured bare areas on the face. These colours can be derived from pigments, or as in the Bali myna, structural colour, caused by light scattering off parallel collagen fibers. The irises of many species are red and yellow, although those of younger birds are much darker.[3]\n\nDistribution, habitat and movements\nThe chestnut-tailed starling is a partial migrant over much of the east of its range, but its movements are poorly understood.\nStarlings inhabit a wide range of habitats from the Arctic Circle to the Equator. The only habitats they do not typically occupy are very dry sandy deserts. The family is naturally absent from the Americas and from large parts of Australia, but it is present over the majority of Europe, Africa, and Asia. The genus Aplonis has also spread widely across the islands of the Pacific, reaching Polynesia, Melanesia, and Micronesia[3] (in addition one species in the genus Mino has reached the Solomon Islands[5]). Also, a species of this genus is the only starling found in northern Australia.[3]\n\nAsian species are most common in evergreen forests; 39 species found in Asia are predominantly forest birds as opposed to 24 found in more open or human modified environments. In contrast to this, African species are more likely to be found in open woodlands and savannah; 33 species are open-area specialists compared to 13 true forest species. The high diversity of species found in Asia and Africa is not matched by Europe, which has one widespread (and very common) species and two more restricted species. The European starling is both highly widespread and extremely eclectic in its habitat, occupying most types of open habitat. Like many other starling species, it has also adapted readily to human-modified habitat, including farmland, orchards, plantations, and urban areas.[3]\n\nSome species of starlings are migratory, either entirely, like Shelley's starling, which breeds in Ethiopia and Somaliland and migrates to Kenya, Tanzania, and Somalia, or like the white-shouldered starling, which is migratory in part of its range, but is resident in others.[3]\n\nThe European starling was purposely introduced to North America in the 1870s through the 1890s by multiple acclimatisation societies, organizations dedicated to introducing European flora and fauna into North America for cultural and economic reasons.[6] A persistent story alleges that Eugene Schieffelin, chairman of the American Acclimatization Society, decided all birds mentioned by William Shakespeare should be in North America, leading to the introduction of the starling to the U.S.; however, this claim is more fiction than fact.[7][6] While Schieffelin and other members of the society did release starlings in Central Park in 1890, the birds had already been in the U.S. since at least the mid-1870s, and Schieffelin was not inspired to do so by Shakespeare's works.[6]\n\nBehaviour\nMurmuration of common starlings at Newport Wetlands Nature Reserve, Wales\nThe starlings are generally a highly social family. Most species associate in flocks of varying sizes throughout the year. Murmuration is the flocking of starlings, including the swarm behaviour of their large flight formations.[8] These flocks may include other species of starlings and sometimes species from other families. This sociality is particularly evident in their roosting behaviour; in the nonbreeding season, some roosts can number in the thousands of birds.[3]\n\nMimic\nStarlings imitate a variety of avian species and have a repertoire of about 15–20 distinct imitations. They also imitate a few sounds other than those of wild birds. The calls of abundant species or calls that are simple in frequency structure and show little amplitude modulation are preferentially imitated. Dialects of mimicked sounds can be local.[3]\n\nDiet and feeding\nMicronesian starlings have been observed feeding on the eggs of seabirds.\n\nThe diets of the starlings are usually dominated by fruits and insects. Many species are important dispersers of seeds, in Asia and Africa, for example, white sandalwood and Indian banyan. In addition to trees, they are also important dispersers of parasitic mistletoes. In South Africa, the red-winged starling is an important disperser of the introduced Acacia cyclops. Starlings have been observed feeding on fermenting over-ripe fruit, which led to the speculation that they might become intoxicated by the alcohol.[3]\n\nLaboratory experiments on European starlings have found that they have disposal enzymes that allow them to break down alcohol very quickly.[9] In addition to consuming fruits, many starlings also consume nectar. The extent to which starlings are important pollinators is unknown, but at least some are, such as the slender-billed starling of alpine East Africa, which pollinates giant lobelias.[3]"

Yet deep in the frozen tundra of the Freljord, there is a vastaya who lives in a blended world of her own...\n\nAurora was born in the secluded village of Aamu, home to the Bryni tribe, and spent her youth playing with critters no one else could see while exploring a world no one else could appreciate. Though she was happy, she felt isolated from the rest of Aamu. Even her parents didn’t understand her, believing Aurora’s “friends” were merely imaginary.\n\nThe only Bryni who wholeheartedly embraced Aurora was her great aunt Havu, who always entertained her stories, fostered her passions, and encouraged her to celebrate her individuality. So Aurora learned to be herself and revel in her own company.\n\nAs Aurora grew older, she realized something: Her invisible friends were not imaginary, but spirits. The beautiful, vibrant world she lived in was completely unique, for only her eyes could pierce through the veil between the realm of mortals and spirits.\n\nShe meticulously documented this intertwined world, studying Aamu's spirits in hopes of helping others understand the realms as she saw them.\n\nOver time, more and more spirits appeared in Aamu, including ones who felt… different. Lost and wild, they had become \"wayward\" when the balance between realms was disturbed by mortal affairs. But after investigating this phenomenon, Aurora discovered she could help these spirits return home by getting to the root of their pain.\n\nThis was difficult work, but in it, Aurora found her life's purpose.\n\nShe knew that continuing her research meant she had to explore the world outside of Aamu. Though the idea of change made her nervous, the prospect of expanding her knowledge inspired Aurora to leave her home behind.\n\nIt was during her travels that she encountered a wayward spirit who took the form of a monstrous, twisted elk. He was feral and afraid, lashing out with bloodstained antlers. Aurora was determined to calm him down, and though it took time, she earned his trust. But this spirit was unlike the others—with every attempt to help him, Aurora failed. Undeterred, she convinced the afflicted elk to travel with her, using her powers to tuck him away in the spirit realm as she worked to unravel his mystery.\n\nHaving come across a number of spirit walkers as she traversed the Freljord, Aurora sought their advice, believing their ability to channel spirits may shed some light on what plagued her wayward companion. However, they too were at a loss, suggesting she find Udyr, the tundra’s most powerful spirit walker.\n\nUdyr needed just one look to recognize the immense power of Aurora's spirit friend, but the fearsome elk was too lost to commune with. Instead, he encouraged her to ask the demigods for answers.\n\nAurora decided to first search for the Great Ram, Ornn. She traveled far through ice and snow to study the artifacts of his followers, the Hearthblood, hoping to learn where they had worshiped him. Only through her persistent research was she at last able to discern the location of Hearth-Home—but where once stood a grand settlement was nothing but ruin and rubble.\n\nAurora knew this was not as it appeared. Using her ability to open a doorway between realms, she stepped inside and was met with the great hall of Ornn's forge, alive with roaring fire.\n\nOrnn was not receptive to his new visitor—but in time, he realized that she, like him, valued solitude and quiet. As he grew to trust her, Ornn finally shared the name of Aurora’s companion: Haestryr. One of Ornn's siblings, Hestrelk, as he was once commonly called, was originally a powerful demigod, but with the waning worship of the Old Gods, many demigods had lost their identities and become distorted shadows of who they once were.\n\nThis revelation about her wayward friend brought Aurora one step closer to helping him find his way home, but there was still a long journey ahead of her.\n\nFrom Ornn, she learned about Ysjarn, the cryophoenix who guides and protects the land while enduring an eternal cycle of birth, life, and death. And, though painful, Ornn also spoke of his brother Valhir, whose relentless storm rages against the Freljord in his desperation to quench the Vorrijaard's bloodlust with the rains of war.\n\nBelieving these demigods hold the key to Hestrelk’s recovery, Aurora has left Hearth-Home and now traverses through the material and spirit realms of her frozen homeland in unwavering pursuit of their knowledge.\n\nPlease summarize this short story in at least 300 words, but no more than 1000.

Kids Just Want to Have Fun\nby Julie Jaggernath\nKids having fun with friends during Spring BreakSpring Break is a mere few weeks away and if you’ve got school-aged kids or teens, you’re likely looking for ways to keep your brood busy. While escaping the winter weather and going away for some fun in the sun isn’t always possible or affordable, there are still lots of options for having a great Spring Break without travelling.\n\nHere are some things to consider as you make your plans for a fun and affordable Spring Break:\n\nAsk Your Kids What They Want to Do for Spring Break\nTalk to your kids. Let them know that they get to help choose what they’d like to do while staying close to home this year. Their lives are likely as busy as yours, so you might be surprised to learn that they wouldn’t mind having some down time at home.\n\nIf your children are quite young, keep it simple and ask what they’d like to do with their friends and family while they’re not at school. Most kids miss their friends during school breaks, so having extra time to spend with them is usually a hit!\n\nHow to Plan Affordable Activities\nDepending on what your kids want to do, look for ways to keep plans affordable. Sign them up for a day camp rather than a week away; enrol them in a half-day course with a friend; trade off daycare or driving duties with another parent; ask a grandparent or other family member to spend time with them.\n\nIf you want to take in a local attraction or event, look for deals online before you go. For camps, check your local recreation guides. They often have part-day camps to help your child learn a new skill or get better at something they already enjoy.\n\nKeep Your Teens Busy\nWith older teens, Spring Break is a great time to look for a part-time job, work on getting volunteer experience, or spend time visiting local post-secondary institutions. Help your teen make a plan ahead of time so that they know what they’ll be doing. It can be tempting for them to just hang with friends or sleep the week away. Keeping teens busy also helps to avoid the drain on your fridge and cupboards!\n\nRelated article: 12 Ways to Save Big on Groceries\n\nPlan a Family Staycation\nMany families are opting for staycations, or being tourists in their own town. Just like with a vacation, make a plan for what you want to do on your staycation. The intent of a staycation is to relax without the stress or expense of travelling. As a bonus, you get to sleep in your own bed and no one asks if you’re there yet.\n\nA staycation is not a time for chores, renovations, honey-do lists or for your kids to catch up on homework assignments. If you have work to do, that should be a separate plan for either before or after the fun.\n\nCreate a Spring Break Spending Plan\nMost parents don’t get as much time off work as their kids get off school, so planning affordable ways to keep kids busy is a never-ending job. Determine your budget ahead of time so that you know what you can afford to spend on Spring Break; then work backwards. Staying home really can be fun!\n\nPlanning what you CAN spend money on is a whole lot easier than looking at what you can’t spend. The break at Spring Break should, after all be in your schedules, not your bank account."

      "Summarize this article about the film, Dirty Dancing.  I am presenting a power point about my favorite movie for my film class, so I need the summary to be suitable for slides.  I am thinking it would be good to split up the main topics and provide 3 key points for each in bullet points.  For the last slide, I would like all of the film's awards and accolades listed.\n\nDirty Dancing is a 1987 American romantic drama dance film written by Eleanor Bergstein, produced by Linda Gottlieb, and directed by Emile Ardolino. Starring Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey, it tells the story of Frances \"Baby\" Houseman (Grey), a young woman who falls in love with dance instructor Johnny Castle (Swayze) at a vacation resort.\n\nThe film was based on screenwriter Bergstein's own childhood. She originally wrote a screenplay for the Michael Douglas film It's My Turn, but she ultimately ended up conceiving a story for a film which became Dirty Dancing. She finished the script in 1985, but management changes at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer put the film in development hell. The production company was changed to Vestron Pictures with Emile Ardolino as director and Linda Gottlieb as producer. Filming took place in Lake Lure, North Carolina, and Mountain Lake, Virginia, with the film's score composed by John Morris and dance choreography by Kenny Ortega.\n\nDirty Dancing premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 12, 1987 and was released on August 21 in the United States, earning over $214 million worldwide—$64 million in the US and Canada and $150 million in other territories. It earned positive reviews from critics, who particularly praised the performances of Grey and Swayze, and its soundtrack, created by Jimmy Lenner, generated two multi-platinum albums and multiple singles. \"(I've Had) The Time of My Life\", performed by Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes, won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, and the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. In 2024, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\nThe film's popularity successfully launched its titular franchise, including a 1988 television series, multiple reality competition shows, a 2004 prequel titled Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights, a stage production which has had sellout performances in multiple countries, a made-for-television musical adaptation in 2017, and an untitled sequel scheduled to be released in 2025, with Grey reprising her role.\n\nPlot\nIn the summer of 1963, teenager Frances \"Baby\" Houseman is vacationing with her family—cardiologist father Jake, mother Marge and older sister Lisa—at Kellerman's, an upscale Catskills resort in the Borscht Belt owned by Jake's sarcastic best friend Max. Exploring one night, Baby secretly observes Max instructing the waiters, all Ivy League students, to romance the guests' daughters, no matter how unattractive. Max also demeans the working-class entertainment staff, including Johnny Castle, one of the dance instructors. Baby is attracted to Johnny and dances briefly with him after his kindhearted cousin, Billy, introduces them at a secret \"dirty dancing\" party for resort staff. Max's grandson Neil flirts with Baby in the meantime.\n\nBaby learns Johnny's dance partner Penny is pregnant by Robbie, a waiter and womanizer who attends the Yale School of Medicine and now has his eye on Lisa. When Robbie refuses to help Penny, Baby borrows money from her father, without explaining why, to pay for Penny's abortion. At first, Penny declines as it would cause her and Johnny to miss a performance at a nearby resort, costing them the season's salary, but Baby volunteers to stand in for Penny. During her dance sessions with Johnny, they develop a mutual attraction, and despite their failure to execute a climactic lift, Johnny and Baby's performance is successful.\n\nBack at Kellerman's, Penny is badly injured by the botched abortion, and Baby enlists her father's help to stabilize Penny. Angered by Baby's deception, and assuming Johnny got Penny pregnant, Dr. Houseman commands Baby to stay away from them. Baby sneaks off to apologize to Johnny for her father's treatment, but Johnny feels he deserves it due to his lower status; Baby reassures him of his worth, declaring her love. They begin secretly seeing each other, and her father refuses to talk to her.\n\n\nScene from the dancing finale\nJohnny rejects an indecent proposal by Vivian Pressman, an adulterous wife, who instead sleeps with Robbie, inadvertently foiling Lisa's plan to lose her virginity to him. When Vivian spots Baby leaving Johnny's cabin, she feels spurned and attempts revenge on Johnny by claiming he stole her husband's wallet. Max is ready to fire Johnny, but Baby backs up his alibi, revealing she was with Johnny the night of the theft. The real thieves, Sydney and Sylvia Schumacher, are caught, but Johnny is still fired for mixing with Baby. Before leaving, Johnny tries to talk to Dr. Houseman but is accused of only trying to get at Baby. Baby later apologizes to her father for lying, but not for her romance with Johnny, and then accuses him of classism.\n\nAt the end-of-season talent show, Dr. Houseman gives Robbie a recommendation letter for medical school, but when Robbie admits that he got Penny pregnant, and then insults her and Baby, Dr. Houseman angrily grabs the letter back. Johnny arrives and disrupts the final song by bringing Baby up on stage and declaring that she has made him a better person, and then they perform the dance they practiced all summer, ending with a successful climactic lift. Dr. Houseman admits he was wrong about Johnny and reconciles with Baby, and all the staff and guests join Baby and Johnny dancing to \"(I've Had) The Time of My Life\".\n\nCast\nJennifer Grey as Frances \"Baby\" Houseman\nPatrick Swayze as Johnny Castle\nJerry Orbach as Jake Houseman\nCynthia Rhodes as Penny Johnson\nJack Weston as Max Kellerman\nJane Brucker as Lisa Houseman\nKelly Bishop as Marge Houseman\nLonny Price as Neil Kellerman\nMax Cantor as Robbie Gould\nCharles Honi Coles as Tito Suarez\nNeal Jones as Billy Kostecki\nWayne Knight as Stan\nPaula Trueman as Sylvia Schumacher\nAlvin Myerovich as Sydney Schumacher\nMiranda Garrison as Vivian Pressman\nGarry Goodrow as Moe Pressman\n\"Cousin Brucie\" Morrow appears in a cameo as a magician; Morrow himself could be heard as a DJ's voice in different parts of the film. Emile Ardolino and Matthew Broderick (who was dating Grey at the time and co-starred with her in Ferris Bueller's Day Off) have cameos.\n\nProduction\nPre-production\nDirty Dancing is based in large part on screenwriter Eleanor Bergstein's own childhood: she is the younger daughter of a Jewish doctor from New York and had spent summers with her family in the Catskills where she participated in \"Dirty Dancing\" competitions; she was also nicknamed \"Baby\" herself as a girl. In 1980, Bergstein wrote a screenplay for the Michael Douglas film It's My Turn; however, the producers cut an erotic dancing scene from the script, prompting her to conceive a new story that took inspiration from her youth dance competitions. In 1984, she pitched the idea to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) executive Eileen Miselle, who liked it and teamed Bergstein with producer Linda Gottlieb. They set the film in 1963, with the character of Baby based on Bergstein's own life and the character of Johnny based on the stories of Michael Terrace, a dance instructor whom Bergstein met in the Catskills in 1985 while she was researching the story. She finished the script in November 1985, but management changes at MGM put the script into turnaround, or limbo.\n\nBergstein gave the script to other studios but was repeatedly rejected until she brought it to Vestron Pictures. While honing their pitch to Vestron, Gottlieb had agreed to cut the proposed budget in half. Bergstein and Gottlieb then chose Emile Ardolino as the film's director; Ardolino had never directed a feature film, but was extremely passionate about the project after reading the script while he was on jury duty. The team of Gottlieb, Bergstein, and Ardolino then presented their vision for the film to Vestron's president, Jon Peisinger, and the company's vice president for production, Mitchell Cannold. By the end of the meeting, Peisinger had greenlit the project to become Vestron's first feature film production. The approved film was budgeted at the relatively low amount of $5 million, at a time when the average cost for a film was $12 million.\n\nFor choreographer, Bergstein chose Kenny Ortega, who had been trained by Gene Kelly. For a location, they did not find anything suitable in the Catskills (as many of the Borscht Belt resorts had been shut down at that point), so they decided on a combination of two locations: Lake Lure, North Carolina, and the Mountain Lake Hotel near Pembroke, Virginia, and with careful editing made it look like all shooting was done in the same area.\n\nCasting\nDirector Ardolino was adamant that they choose dancers, such as Swayze, who could also act, as he did not want to use the \"stand-in\" method that had been used with Flashdance (1983).\n\nFor the female lead of Frances \"Baby\" Houseman, Winona Ryder, Sarah Jessica Parker and Sharon Stone were considered. Bergstein chose the 26-year-old Jennifer Grey, daughter of the Oscar-winning actor and dancer Joel Grey (Cabaret (1972)). Grey was paid $50,000 (equivalent to $140,000 in 2024) for her role. The producers then sought a male lead, initially considering 20-year-old Billy Zane, though initial screen tests when he was partnered with Grey did not meet expectations. Val Kilmer and Benicio del Toro were also considered for Johnny. The next choice was 34-year-old Patrick Swayze, who appeared in Grandview, U.S.A. (1984) and had co-starred with Grey on Red Dawn (1984). He was a seasoned dancer, with experience from the Joffrey Ballet. The producers were thrilled with him, but his resume read \"No dancing\" after a knee injury. However, Swayze read the script, liked the multi-level character of Johnny, and took the part anyway. After this, Johnny's heritage was changed from being Italian to Irish. Grey was initially not happy about the choice, as she and Swayze had difficulty getting along on Red Dawn, but when they did their dancing screen test, the chemistry between them was obvious. Bergstein described it as \"breathtaking\". Other casting choices were Broadway actor Jerry Orbach as Dr. Jake Houseman, Baby's father; and Jane Brucker as Lisa Houseman, her older sister.\n\nBergstein, as the film's writer, also attempted to cast her friend, sex therapist Dr. Ruth Westheimer, to play Mrs. Schumacher (and Joel Grey as Dr. Ruth's husband). However, Westheimer backed out when she learned the role involved her playing a thief. The role went instead to 89-year-old Paula Trueman.\n\nAnother role went to Bergstein's friend, New York radio personality \"Cousin Brucie\" Morrow. She initially wanted him to portray the social director, but then later asked him to play the part of the magician. Morrow himself could be heard at different parts of the movie as a New York area DJ (at the time of the film's setting he was working at WABC, a top 40 station), and served as period music consultant. The role of the social director went to the then-unknown Wayne Knight (later of Seinfeld and 3rd Rock from the Sun fame).\n\nThe part of Baby's mother was originally given to Lynne Lipton, who is briefly visible in the beginning, when the Houseman family first pulls into Kellerman's (she is in the front seat for a few seconds; her blonde hair is the only indication), but she became ill during the first week of shooting and was replaced by actress Kelly Bishop, who had already been cast to play resort guest Vivian Pressman. Bishop moved into the role of Mrs. Houseman, and the film's assistant choreographer Miranda Garrison took on the role of Vivian. (When Baby is dancing in the final scene, the line that her mother says to Jerry Orbach, \"She gets that from me ...\" is a wink to the fact that Kelly Bishop was in the original cast of A Chorus Line winning a 1976 Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical for her performance, using the name at that time of Carole Bishop, and had been a professional dancer.)\n\nFilming\n\nMountain Lake Hotel, Virginia, the filming location of the Kellerman's Hotel\nPrincipal photography for Dirty Dancing took place in Lake Lure, North Carolina, and Mountain Lake, Virginia. Scenes in Lake Lure were filmed at a former Boy Scout Camp called Camp Chimney Rock, which is now a private, residential community known as Firefly Cove where only the stone steps where Baby practiced still exist. These scenes included the interior dancing scenes, Baby carrying the watermelon and practicing on the signature stairs, Johnny's cabin, the staff cabins and the dances on a log. The final dance scene was filmed at the camp gymnasium, which no longer stands. The golf scene where Baby asks her father for $250 was filmed at Rumbling Bald Golf Course. Scenes filmed at Mountain Lake included dining scenes, Kellerman's Hotel, the beach games, the Houseman family's cabins, the water lift scene and Penny crying in the kitchen.\n\nFilming started for Dirty Dancing on September 5, 1986, and lasted just 43 days. The production had to battle bad weather, including outside temperatures of 105 °F. With the camera and lighting equipment needed for filming, the temperature inside could be as high as 120 °F. According to choreographer Kenny Ortega, 10 people passed out within 25 minutes of shooting one day. Paula Trueman collapsed and was taken to the local emergency room to be treated for dehydration. Patrick Swayze also required a hospital visit; insisting on doing his own stunts, he repeatedly fell off the log during the \"balancing\" scene and injured his knee so badly he had to have fluid drained from the swelling.\n\nDelays in the shooting schedule pushed filming into the autumn, which required the set decorators to spray-paint the autumn leaves green. The weather became cold, causing the lake's temperatures to drop to near 40 °F for the famous swimming scene, which was filmed in October. Despite her character's enjoyment, Grey later described the water as \"horrifically\" cold, and she might not have gone into the lake, except that she was \"young and hungry\".\n\nRelations between the two main stars varied throughout production. They had already had trouble getting along in their previous project, Red Dawn (1984), and worked things out enough to have an extremely positive screen test, but that initial cooperation soon faded, and they were soon \"facing off\" before every scene. To address this, producer Bergstein and director Ardolino forced the stars to re-watch their initial screen-tests—the ones with the \"breathtaking\" chemistry. This had the desired effect, and Swayze and Grey were able to return to the film with renewed energy and enthusiasm.\n\nSome of the scenes in the film are improvised. For example, the scene where Grey was to stand in front of Swayze with her back to him and put her arm up behind his head while he trailed his fingers down her arm. Grey was exhausted at the time and found the move ticklish, and could not stop giggling each time Swayze tried it, and he became annoyed. The footage was found in the editing room and the producers decided the scene worked as it was and put it into the film, complete with Grey's giggling and Swayze's annoyed expression. It became one of the most famous scenes in the movie, turning out, as choreographer Kenny Ortega put it, \"as one of the most delicate and honest moments in the film.\" Grey has stated that the final climactic lift was never rehearsed and only ever done on the day the scene was shot."

I am into penguins, so make sure any details about them are included. Highlight any quotes by putting them in a paragraph of their own.\n\nGiant iceberg on crash course with island, putting penguins and seals in danger\n\nThe world's largest iceberg is on a collision course with a remote British island, potentially putting penguins and seals in danger.\n\nThe iceberg is spinning northwards from Antarctica towards South Georgia, a rugged British territory and wildlife haven, where it could ground and smash into pieces. It is currently 173 miles (280km) away.\n\nCountless birds and seals died on South Georgia's icy coves and beaches when past giant icebergs stopped them feeding.\n\n\"Icebergs are inherently dangerous. I would be extraordinarily happy if it just completely missed us,\" sea captain Simon Wallace tells BBC News, speaking from the South Georgia government vessel Pharos.\n\nAround the world a group of scientists, sailors and fishermen are anxiously checking satellite pictures to monitor the daily movements of this queen of icebergs.\n\nIt is known as A23a and is one of the world's oldest.\n\nIt calved, or broke off, from the Filchner Ice Shelf in Antarctica in 1986 but got stuck on the seafloor and then trapped in an ocean vortex.\n\nFinally, in December, it broke free and is now on its final journey, speeding into oblivion.\n\nThe warmer waters north of Antarctica are melting and weakening its vast cliffs that tower up to 1,312ft (400m), taller than the Shard in London.\n\nIt once measured 3,900 sq km, but the latest satellite pictures show it is slowly decaying. It is now around 3,500 sq km, roughly the size of the English county of Cornwall.\n\nAnd large slabs of ice are breaking off, plunging into the waters around its edges.\n\nA23a could break into vast segments any day, which may then hang around for years, like floating cities of ice cruising uncontrollably around South Georgia.\n\nThis isn't the first huge iceberg to threaten South Georgia and Sandwich Islands.\n\nIn 2004 one called A38 grounded on its continental shelf, leaving dead penguin chicks and seal pups on beaches as massive ice chunks blocked their access to feeding grounds.\n\nThe territory is home to precious colonies of King penguins and millions of elephant and fur seals.\n\n\"South Georgia sits in iceberg alley so impacts are to be expected for both fisheries and wildlife, and both have a great capacity to adapt,\" says Mark Belchier, a marine ecologist who advises the South Georgia government.\n\nSailors and fisherman say icebergs are an increasing problem. In 2023 one called A76 gave them a scare when it came close to grounding.\n\n\"Chunks of it were tipping up, so they looked like great ice towers, an ice city on the horizon,\" says Mr Belchier, who saw the iceberg while at sea.\n\nThose slabs are still lingering around the islands today.\n\n\"It is in bits from the size of several Wembley stadiums down to pieces the size of your desk,\" says Andrew Newman from Argos Froyanes, a fishing company that works in South Georgia.\n\n\"Those pieces basically cover the island - we have to work our way through it,\" says Captain Wallace.\n\nThe sailors on his ship must be constantly vigilant. \"We have searchlights on all night to try to see ice - it can come from nowhere,\" he explains.\n\nA76 was a \"gamechanger\", according to Mr Newman, with \"huge impact on our operations and on keeping our vessel and crew safe\".\n\nAll three men describe a rapidly changing environment, with glacial retreat visible year-to-year, and volatile levels of sea ice.\n\nClimate change is unlikely to have been behind the birth of A23a because it calved so long ago, before much of the impacts of rising temperatures that we are now seeing.\n\nBut giant icebergs are part of our future. As Antarctica becomes more unstable with warmer ocean and air temperatures, more vast pieces of the ice sheets will break away.\n\nBefore its time comes to an end though, A23a has left a parting gift for scientists.\n\nA team with the British Antarctic Survey on the Sir David Attenborough research vessel found themselves close to A23a in 2023.\n\nThe scientists scrambled to exploit the rare opportunity to investigate what mega icebergs do to the environment.\n\nThe ship sailed into a crack in the iceberg's gigantic walls, and PhD researcher Laura Taylor collected precious water samples 400m away from its cliffs.\n\n\"I saw a massive wall of ice way higher than me, as far as I could see. It has different colours in different places. Chunks were falling off - it was quite magnificent,\" she explains from her lab in Cambridge where she is now analysing the samples.\n\nHer work looks at what the impact the melt water is having on the carbon cycle in the southern ocean.\n\n\"This isn't just water like we drink. It's full of nutrients and chemicals, as well as tiny animals like phytoplankton frozen inside,\" Ms Taylor says.\n\nAs it melts, the iceberg releases those elements into the water, changing the physics and chemistry of the ocean.\n\nThat could store more carbon deep in the ocean, as the particles sink from the surface. That would naturally lock away some of the planet's carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to climate change.\n\nIcebergs are notoriously unpredictable and no-one knows what exactly it will do next.\n\nBut soon the behemoth should appear, looming on the islands' horizons, as big as the territory itself."

Summarize what the Suns players' reactions were to this trade, but do not include their names. I would also like one sentence at the end describing which team benefitted the most from this trade. Make sure this summary is no longer than 5 sentences long total. \"NEW YORK -- In a blockbuster trade that figures to impact the Western Conference balance of power for years to come, the Lakers, Mavericks and Jazz completed a three-team trade that sends Luka Doncic to Los Angeles and Anthony Davis to Dallas.\n\nThe Lakers received Doncic, Maxi Kleber and Markieff Morris from the Mavericks, who announced the trade Sunday morning. Dallas acquired Davis, Max Christie and the Lakers' 2029 first-round pick.\n\nThe Jazz received Jalen Hood-Schifino, the LA Clippers' 2025 second-round pick and the Mavericks' 2025 second-round selection.\n\n\"I believe that defense wins championships,\" Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison told ESPN's Tim MacMahon, explaining his motivation to deal Doncic for Davis. \"I believe that getting an All-Defensive center and an All-NBA player with a defensive mindset gives us a better chance. We're built to win now and in the future.\" \nThe trade talks were initiated by Dallas, league sources told ESPN, and began a few days ago. Harrison and Rob Pelinka, the Lakers' vice president of basketball operations and general manager, have a long-standing relationship dating to when Harrison was Kobe Bryant's marketing manager at Nike and Pelinka was Bryant's agent.\n\nThe Lakers' front office, ownership group and coaching staff were in alignment on the deal, excited to acquire a young superstar in Doncic while recognizing it takes a lot to get a lot in the NBA.\n\n\"Luka is a one-of-a-kind, young global superstar who will lead this franchise for years to come,\" Pelinka said in a statement released by the team Sunday. \"His killer instincts and commitment to winning championships will be a driving force for the team. We will be relentless in building a roster around the on-court vision Coach Redick has for this basketball team and there is an unwavering commitment to that work to serve our loyal and dedicated fans. We are grateful for today and look forward to what's next.\"\n\nAfter the Lakers and Mavericks agreed to the deal late Saturday night, sources told ESPN that Pelinka made three calls in quick succession: a joint call with Davis and Lakers coach JJ Redick; a call to Davis' agent, Rich Paul of Klutch Sports; and a call to LeBron James.\n\nHarrison told the Dallas Morning News that he texted Doncic and left him a voicemail.\n\n\"My guess is he probably doesn't want to talk to me,\" Harrison told the newspaper.\n\nJames learned of the trade when it broke while he was out to dinner with family after Saturday's win against the Knicks in New York, sources close to the Lakers superstar told ESPN. James was surprised by the news, sources said. Davis and Doncic were also not informed of the trade ahead of time, sources told Charania.\n\nThe deal pairs Doncic with James as the new 1-2 punch in Los Angeles, while Davis would be forming a new star duo with Kyrie Irving in Dallas. James intends to stay with the Lakers beyond Thursday's trade deadline, a source familiar with the four-time MVP's plans told ESPN, confirming a report earlier Sunday from NBA reporter Chris Haynes.\n\nThe trade also reunites Doncic with Redick, his former Mavericks teammate. Doncic was one of the Mavericks players on the floor when Redick came out of a game for the final time on May 11, 2021.\n\nDavis waived his $5.9 million trade kicker as a part of the deal, sources told ESPN. The decision was made to give the Mavericks flexibility with the salary cap to be as competitive as possible while also recognizing that the money can be made back in other ways, with no state taxes in Texas and in signing a contract extension with Dallas in the future.\n\nThe Mavericks were motivated to move Doncic because of his constant conditioning concerns, sources told MacMahon. There had been significant frustration within the organization about Doncic's lack of discipline regarding his diet and conditioning, which team sources considered a major factor in his injury issues.\n\nThough Doncic was relatively lean by his standards when he reported to camp, his weight ballooned to the high 260s early this season, sources said. He sat out five games in late November, when the Mavericks listed him with a sprained right wrist, an extended absence to allow Doncic to focus on his conditioning. He had a similar early-season layoff in the 2022-23 season.\n\nDoncic has been limited to 22 games this season because of a variety of injuries. He has twice strained his left calf since reporting to Dallas before training camp in late September, although the Mavericks reported the fall injury only as a calf contusion, sources said.\n\nDoncic has not played since straining his calf again on Christmas Day but has been targeting a return before the All-Star break later this month, sources told MacMahon. Davis has sat out the Lakers' past two games after being diagnosed with an abdominal muscle strain earlier this week. Davis was expected to be reevaluated in a week, the Lakers said Wednesday.\n\nDoncic was in line to receive a five-year, $345 million contract this summer, but because of the trade, he is no longer eligible for a supermax deal, according to ESPN's Bobby Marks.\n\n\"We really feel like we got ahead of what was going to be a tumultuous summer, him being eligible for the supermax and also a year away from him being able to opt out of any contract,\" Harrison told the Dallas Morning News. \"And so we really felt like we got out in front of that. We know teams, they've had it out there, teams have been loading up to try to sign him once that comes available.\"\n\nThe deal is as stunning as it is historic. It's the first time that two reigning All-NBA players have been traded for each other midseason, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.\n\nDavis will join a team featuring a coaching staff led by Jason Kidd, who was an assistant coach with the Lakers' 2020 championship team, and assistant coach Jared Dudley, who was a role player on the 2020 Lakers squad.\n\nDavis told ESPN's Shams Charania last month that he thought the Lakers needed to add another big man, saying he has \"always been at my best when I've been the 4.\"\n\nThe 6-foot-10 Davis now joins a Dallas team that already boasts size in its frontcourt, with emerging 6-10 center Daniel Gafford and 7-1 center Dereck Lively II, who is sidelined with an ankle injury.\n\n\"I think if you look at the Cleveland Cavaliers, that's what you're going to see,\" Harrison told the Dallas Morning News in a reference to Cleveland's frontcourt of Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen. \"Anthony's probably going to finish games at the 5, but you're going to see those guys play together. And when the Lakers won, he played the 4.\"\n\nThere was one game -- Phoenix-Portland -- still going on in the NBA on Saturday night when reports began swirling of the trade. Suns guard Devin Booker said someone in the stands told him and his teammates of the trade.\n\n\"They said Luka. I said, Luka Garza?'\" Booker said, referencing the Minnesota Timberwolves center.\n\nBooker wasn't trying to be funny. He just thought what many probably thought -- that there was no way the Mavericks would move Doncic.\n\n\"It's crazy, man. I really don't know what to say about it,\" Booker said. \"Luka being a guy that everybody has claimed is untouchable and untradeable. The NBA shows you again. Can't predict. It's a business. They're always having a conversation about you. So don't think you're safer than you are.\"\n\nAdded fellow Suns star Kevin Durant: \"Insane. It's crazy. Crazy. Damn, would of never thought Luka Doncic would get traded. At his age, midseason, the NBA is a wild place, man. If he can get traded, then anybody is up for grabs.\"\n\nThere was immediate shock on social media when the news hit as well.\n\n\"Luka getting traded from Dallas has to have a deeper story behind it,\" Cavaliers center Tristan Thompson wrote on X. \"This just doesn't happen on a random Saturday night.\"\n\n\"Wait what?\" posted Patrick Mahomes, the star Kansas City Chiefs quarterback who sits courtside at Mavericks games occasionally during the offseason, NBA playoffs included.\n\nAnd Knicks guard Jalen Brunson wondered if it was a joke: \"April fools right?\" he asked.\n\nThe trade significantly altered the NBA betting market, as the Lakers moved from 40-1 to 16-1 to win the NBA title at ESPN BET early Sunday morning, behind only the Oklahoma City Thunder (+225) and Denver Nuggets (+1400) in the Western Conference.\n\nThe Mavericks, on the other hand, dropped from 25-1 to 40-1 at ESPN BET before moving back to 33-1 early Sunday.\n\nThe Lakers entered Saturday tied with the Timberwolves and Suns for the 11th-longest championship odds. But after the trade, the Lakers leapfrogged the Timberwolves, Suns, Clippers, Rockets, Grizzlies, Bucks and Mavericks to have the sixth-shortest odds.\n\nAmong players with at least 400 games, Doncic's 28.6-point average is third in NBA history behind only Michael Jordan and Wilt Chamberlain -- both at 30.1.\n\nDoncic also is one of only three players in NBA history with career averages of at least 25 points, seven rebounds and seven assists per game. The other two are James and Oscar Robertson.\n\nDoncic was third in the MVP voting last season after averaging 33.9 points, 9.8 assists and 9.2 rebounds per game, easily one of the greatest statistical seasons in league history. Doncic -- who turns 26 later this month and has referred to James as an \"idol\" -- had a 73-point game against the Atlanta Hawks on Jan. 26, 2024, tying the fourth-highest scoring total ever in an NBA game. Only Chamberlain (100), Bryant (81) and Chamberlain (78) scored more.\n\nDavis, an All-Star pick this year for the 10th time in his career, turns 32 next month. He was part of the NBA's 75th anniversary team, helped the Lakers win the NBA title in the bubble in 2020 and -- like Doncic -- is a five-time All-NBA selection.\n\n\"We are overwhelmingly thankful for AD's six seasons with the Lakers, where he led our franchise to a championship and cemented himself as a perennial NBA All-Star,\" Pelinka said in his statement Sunday. \"We are proud of Max Christie's development as a Laker as he has grown into an impact 3-and-D player and we are appreciative of the work Jalen Hood-Schifino has put in to show professionalism at every level.\"\n\nDoncic is averaging 28.1 points, 8.3 rebounds and 7.8 assists per game this season. Davis is averaging 25.7 points and 11.9 rebounds.\n\nDallas plays at Cleveland on Sunday, while the Lakers are off until visiting the Clippers on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Lakers and Mavericks play each other twice more in the regular season: first on Feb. 25 in Los Angeles and then on April 9 in Dallas.\"\n\n"

      "Can you summarize the general view of amphibious homes from this article? Make sure to keep it in a positive light. If there are any questionable aspects of this proposal, include them, but follow with an upside or beneficial outcome. End the summary with an overall consensus, even if you have to stretch it. Make it more like a story about change in the face of adversity through adaptability rather than struggle and hardship.\n\nLast June, not long after a catastrophic thunderstorm swept through southern Ontario, bringing a month’s worth of rain in just a few hours, a group of 75 architects, engineers, and policymakers from 16 countries gathered in the city of Waterloo to discuss how humanity will cope with its waterlogged future. The timing of the conference was a fitting meteorological coincidence; in a world increasingly transformed by climate change, heavy rains, and major floods are becoming more common, at least in some areas. In the summer of 2017 alone, Hurricane Harvey dumped more than 50 inches of rain over Texas; a monster monsoon season damaged more than 800,000 homes in India; and flash floods and mudslides claimed at least 500 lives in Sierra Leone. In the past two decades, the world’s ten worst floods have done more than 165 billion dollars worth of damage and driven more than a billion people from their homes.\n\nIt was statistics like these that animated the experts who had assembled in Ontario for the International Conference on Amphibious Architecture, Design, and Engineering, a three-day event organized by Elizabeth English, an associate professor at the University of Waterloo. Unlike traditional buildings, amphibious structures are not static; they respond to floods like ships to a rising tide, floating on the water’s surface. As one of English’s colleagues put it, “You can think of these buildings as little animals that have their feet wet and can then lift themselves up as needed.” Amphibiation may be an unconventional strategy, but it reflects a growing consensus that, at a time of climatic volatility, people can’t simply fight against water; they have to learn to live with it. “With amphibious construction, water becomes your friend,” English told me. “The water gets to do what the water wants to do. It’s not a confrontation with Mother Nature—it’s an acceptance of Mother Nature.”\n\nEnglish began her career focused on an altogether different force of nature: wind. After earning degrees in architecture and engineering, she eventually landed at Louisiana State University’s Hurricane Center, where she studied the effects of wind loads on buildings and the aerodynamics of windborne debris. In August of 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, about 70 miles southeast of her home in Baton Rouge. The storm’s high-speed winds peeled roofs off buildings and flung debris through windows, but it was the flooding that really shocked English. “Katrina was much more a water event than a wind event,” she said. “I started looking at the implications of all the flood damage and the social disruption that it caused, and I became very, very angry about the cultural insensitivity of the solutions that were being proposed.”\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, the federal government recommended that residents permanently elevate their houses, lifting them up onto raised foundations or stilts. But English worried that hoisting the city’s low-slung, shotgun-style houses into the air would ruin its sense of community, making it more difficult for residents to chat with neighbors and passersby. “People didn’t want to move up,” English said. “And it visually thoroughly destroyed the neighborhoods. There had to be a better way.”\n\nShe discovered that better way in another perpetually sodden locale—the Netherlands, where developers were building a cluster of amphibious homes in a flood-prone region along the Maas River. The houses sat on hollow concrete boxes attached to large steel pillars. During a flood, the boxes would function like the hull of a ship, providing buoyancy. As the waters rose, the buildings would rise, too, sliding up the pillars and floating on the water’s surface. When the waters receded, the houses would descend to their original positions.\n\nIt was an elegant solution, English thought, but not quite what she was looking for. Building a hollow foundation is a major construction project; English wanted to give New Orleanians an easy and inexpensive way to modify their existing homes. In 2006, she founded a nonprofit called the Buoyant Foundation Project and began working with a group of architecture and engineering students to devise a method for retrofitting local homes with amphibious foundations. A typical New Orleans shotgun house sits slightly above the ground, resting atop short piers; the researchers could, they thought, fasten a steel frame to the underside of a house and affix a set of foam buoyancy blocks. Then they could sink posts into the ground and attach them to the corners of the frame, allowing the house to rise up off the piers without floating down the street.\n\nEnglish and her students built a full-scale prototype of the system, and in the summer of 2007, they put it to the test. They borrowed some corral panels from the College of Agriculture and built a temporary flood tank around their model amphibious home, pumping in water straight from the Mississippi River. The tank filled with two, three, four feet of water, and the house began to rise. By the time they stopped pumping, it was hovering about a foot above the piers. “It was a religious experience when it lifted off,” English recalled.\n\nThe system was simple and cheap; it could be installed by two reasonably handy people without heavy equipment for between ten and forty dollars a square foot. It left a building’s appearance and structure almost unchanged, and it was more resilient than permanent elevation, which can cost two or three times as much and make a building more susceptible to wind damage. “This is not a one-size-fits-all solution,” English said, noting that the system would not provide adequate protection against high-speed waves. “But it’s an excellent solution for some circumstances.”\n\nEnglish became so enamored of the approach that she began to think beyond the bayou. In the past decade, she and her colleagues at the Buoyant Foundation Project have designed amphibious housing prototypes for low-income, flood-threatened regions in Nicaragua and Jamaica. They have also consulted with indigenous communities in Canada and Louisiana. (English kept her house there after she moved from L.S.U. to Waterloo in 2007.) Thanks in part to the project’s work, the gospel of amphibiation is spreading. Amphibious buildings are popping up everywhere from the UK, where the firm Baca Architects recently built a buoyant, light-drenched, three-bedroom home on an island in the Thames, to Bangladesh, where a master’s student designed a sustainable affordable housing unit that relies on 8,000 empty plastic water bottles for buoyancy.\n\nStill, amphibious structures remain more an innovative curiosity than a bona fide building trend. It probably doesn’t help that the premise is profoundly counterintuitive. When English first started telling people about her work, they laughed at her. “It seemed so outlandish,” she said. But the biggest hurdles, English told me, are more prosaic. In the United States, federal law requires most homeowners living in high-risk flood zones to purchase flood insurance, but buildings with amphibious foundations are not eligible for the subsidized policies offered by the National Flood Insurance Program. In one of English’s academic papers, she mentions the story of a developer who built an amphibious house in New Orleans, and then found himself unable to acquire an NFIP policy; the building remained unsold until he replaced the amphibious foundation with a traditional one.\n\nIn 2007, after English began promoting her concept on the Buoyant Foundation Project website, an official at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which administers the NFIP, wrote to her. He urged her not to release more information about her design and suggested that communities that permitted the floatable foundations could “jeopardize” their “good standing” with the NFIP. A decade later, FEMA continues to maintain that more research is needed. “Although amphibious-building technology is changing, these systems raise several engineering, floodplain-management, economic, and emergency-management concerns,” an agency spokesperson said in a statement. “A technology that relies on mechanical processes to provide flood protection is not equivalent to the same level of safe protection provided by permanent elevation.”\n\nEnglish isn’t giving up. A few months after the conference, she flew to Vietnam, where she is designing two new amphibious houses that are slated to be built in January. She also has a grant from the National Research Council of Canada to begin developing guidelines for amphibious construction that the government can include in its official building code. English and other experts say that opinions about amphibious architecture are beginning to shift, especially as climate change makes innovative building solutions more urgent. “Usually, after a conference presentation, I’ll have people coming up to me and saying, ‘I’ve never heard of this before, this is such a great idea, how can I do this in my community?’ ” English said. “People don’t laugh at me anymore.”"

      "Please summarize the history of Linux Mint from the provided text. I would like for your summary to be under 200 words, as I don't like to read a lot. Bold any years and names so they're easier to find. Please write your summary so it's easy to understand, I don't need the big complex words. I don't need to know anything after 2015, so please don't include that.\n\nLinux Mint began in 2006 with a beta release, 1.0, code-named 'Ada', based on Kubuntu and using its KDE interface. Linux Mint 2.0 'Barbara' was the first version to use Ubuntu as its codebase and its GNOME interface. It had few users until the release of Linux Mint 3.0, 'Cassandra'. Linux Mint 2.0 was based on Ubuntu 6.10, using Ubuntu's package repositories and using it as a codebase. It then followed its own codebase, building each release from the previous one, but continuing to use the package repositories of the latest Ubuntu release. This made the two systems' bases almost identical, guaranteeing full compatibility between them, rather than requiring Mint to be a fork.\n\nInitially, there were two Linux Mint releases per year, timed to be approximately one month after Ubuntu releases (which in turn are about one month after GNOME releases and two months after X Window System releases). In 2008, Linux Mint adopted the same release cycle as Ubuntu and dropped its minor version number before releasing version 5 'Elyssa', and every fourth release was labeled a long-term support (LTS) version, indicating that it was supported (with updates) for longer than traditional releases. The same year, in an effort to increase compatibility between the two systems, Linux Mint decided to abandon its codebase and starting with Linux Mint 6 'Felicia' each release was based completely on the latest Ubuntu release, built directly from it, and made available approximately one month after the corresponding Ubuntu release (usually in May or November).\n\nIn 2010, Linux Mint released Linux Mint Debian Edition (LMDE). Unlike the other Ubuntu-based editions (Ubuntu Mint), LMDE was originally a rolling release based directly on Debian and not tied to Ubuntu packages or its release schedule. It was announced on May 27, 2015, that the Linux Mint team would no longer support the original rolling release version of LMDE after January 1, 2016. LMDE 2 'Betsy' was a long-term support release based on Debian Jessie. When LMDE 2 was released, it was announced that all LMDE users would be automatically upgraded to new versions of MintTools software and new desktop environments before they were released into the main edition of Linux Mint.\n\nIn 2014 the successor to 17 Qiana was announced to be 17.1 Rebecca; the development team said that from a technical point of view Linux Mint was no longer tied to the Ubuntu schedule, so it could be released at any time, although the six-month cycle provided rhythm, leading to a late November 2014 target.\n\nOn February 20, 2016, the Linux Mint website was breached by unknown hackers who briefly replaced download links for a version of Linux Mint with a modified version containing malware. The hackers also breached the database of the website's user forum. Linux Mint immediately took its server offline and implemented enhanced security configurations for their website and forum.\n\nBeginning with the release of Linux Mint 18 (Sarah), the OEM version, and the No Codecs version was discontinued in order to reduce the number of ISO images that needed to be maintained.\n\nStarting with Linux Mint 20 only 64-bit architecture is supported. This is because Canonical decided to drop 32-bit support from Ubuntu 20.04, which is the base from which Linux Mint 20 is derived. The Debian-based LMDE continues to support 32-bit processors."

These will help you enhance your comprehension skills and confidently tackle challenging texts.\n\n1. Preview the Text to Boost Reading Comprehension\nBefore delving into a complex text, take a moment to preview its structure and content. This simple step can greatly enhance your reading comprehension and retention. By scanning headings, subheadings, and summaries, you can quickly grasp the text’s main ideas and themes.\n\nPreviewing helps you understand the text structure beforehand, making it easier to navigate and process the information. Look for key words and phrases that highlight the main topics and their organization. This initial overview sets your expectations and helps you focus on the most relevant sections.\n\n\nBenefits of Skimming and Previewing\nIdentify the main ideas and themes quickly\nUnderstand how the information is organized\nSet expectations for what you will learn\nFocus your attention on key sections\nImprove overall comprehension and retention\nBy previewing the text before reading, you can save time and effort. Skimming gives you a sense of the content without getting lost in details. This is particularly beneficial when dealing with lengthy or complex materials, such as textbooks or academic articles.\n\n2. Set a Purpose for Reading Comprehension\nBefore starting to read, it’s essential to define a clear reading purpose. Knowing why you’re reading and what you want to learn helps you focus. This simple step boosts your information retention and understanding.\n\nEngaging in selective reading is a powerful strategy. It involves prioritizing sections that match your reading goals. This way, you focus on the most important information, saving time and mental effort. It helps you grasp the most valuable insights from the text.\n\nTo decide which parts to focus on, consider these factors:\n\nThe main themes or topics you need to understand\nSpecific questions you hope to answer through reading\nConcepts that are likely to be tested or applied in the future\nBy concentrating on these key areas, you enhance your reading efficiency. This improves your retention of the material. Here’s a comparison of targeted versus comprehensive reading:\n\nTargeted Reading\tComprehensive Reading\nFocuses on key sections\tCovers every detail\nSaves time and energy\tCan be time-consuming\nImproves retention of important points\tMay lead to information overload\nSetting a clear reading purpose is not about skipping important details. It’s a strategic method to engage with the text more efficiently. This approach enhances your comprehension and retention of the material.\n\n3. Take Notes For Reading Comprehension\nActive reading is a powerful strategy that can significantly enhance your comprehension and retention of information. One of the most effective techniques within active reading is note-taking. It involves highlighting key points and jotting down main ideas as you progress through the text.\n\nWhen you encounter important concepts, facts, or examples, use a highlighter or underline them in the text. This simple act of highlighting helps your brain recognize the significance of the information. It makes it easier to recall later. In addition to highlighting, summarizing sections of the text in your own words is another powerful tool for reinforcing understanding.\n\nnote-taking strategies for better comprehension\nThe Benefits of Summarizing\nSummarizing involves distilling the main points of a section into a concise overview. This process requires you to actively engage with the material, analyzing and synthesizing the key ideas. By putting the concepts into your own words, you strengthen your grasp of the subject matter. You also create a personalized framework for remembering the information.\n\nThere are various methods for taking notes and summarizing, ranging from traditional pen and paper to digital tools like note-taking apps. Experiment with different approaches to find the one that works best for your learning style and preferences. Consistency is key – make note-taking and summarizing a regular part of your reading routine. This will see the most significant improvements in your comprehension and retention.\n\n4. Use Context Clues to Improve Reading Comprehension\nWhen tackling challenging texts, you might come across words you don’t know. Yet, by mastering the art of context clues, you can infer the meaning of unknown words. This skill allows you to keep reading smoothly. Context clues involve analyzing the text around a word to deduce its meaning. This method aids in vocabulary growth as you read.\n\nTo harness context clues, focus on the words and phrases near the unfamiliar term. Seek out synonyms, antonyms, examples, or explanations that offer clues. For example, if you see, “The protagonist’s loquacious nature often led to lengthy conversations,” you can deduce that “loquacious” means talkative or wordy.\n\nContext clues enhance your understanding of the text and boost your vocabulary over time. As you encounter new words in different contexts, your grasp of their meanings and usage expands. This skill is crucial for navigating academic or technical texts filled with specialized terms.\n\nStrategies for Using Context Clues\nRead the sentence with the unknown word and the sentences around it for hints\nSearch for synonyms, antonyms, examples, or explanations close to the word\nConsider the tone and overall message of the passage\nMake an educated guess based on the context and check a dictionary if unsure\nBy becoming proficient in using context clues, you’ll enhance your reading efficiency and confidence. This skill is vital for better comprehension and natural vocabulary expansion.\n\n5. Visualize Concepts for Better Reading Comprehension\nVisualizing concepts is a powerful technique for enhancing reading comprehension and retaining information. By creating mental imagery or diagrams to represent ideas, readers can establish stronger connections between abstract concepts and their visual memory. This approach is particularly effective when processing complex or technical information.\n\nTo utilize visualization as a memory technique, start by identifying the key concepts or ideas within the text. Then, imagine a visual representation of each concept, such as an image, symbol, or diagram. For example, when reading about the water cycle, you might visualize the following stages:\n\nStage\tVisual Representation\nEvaporation\tWater droplets rising from a body of water\nCondensation\tWater vapor forming clouds in the sky\nPrecipitation\tRaindrops or snowflakes falling from clouds\nCollection\tWater accumulating in rivers, lakes, or oceans\n\nBy creating a vivid mental image for each stage, you can better understand and remember the overall process. This technique can be applied to various subjects, from scientific concepts to historical events or literary themes.\n\nLinking Abstract Ideas to Visual Memory\nVisualizing concepts is particularly useful when dealing with abstract ideas that lack a concrete, physical representation. By associating these ideas with memorable images or symbols, you can create a stronger link between the concept and your visual memory, making it easier to recall the information later.\n\nFor instance, when learning about economic concepts like supply and demand, you might visualize a see-saw, with supply on one end and demand on the other. As supply increases, the see-saw tilts in that direction, and as demand increases, it tilts the other way. This visual representation can help you grasp the relationship between these abstract concepts more effectively.\n\nConsistently practicing visualization and mental imagery as a memory technique can significantly improve your reading comprehension and retention of complex information. By linking abstract ideas to visual representations, you can create a more engaging and memorable learning experience.\n\n6. Improve Comprehension By Active Reading\nTo truly absorb and understand written material, it’s essential to practice active reading. This involves engaging with the text on a deeper level, rather than passively skimming the words on the page. One key strategy for active reading is questioning the content as you go along.\n\nBy asking yourself questions about the main ideas, supporting evidence, and implications of what you’re reading, you maintain focus and critically evaluate the information. This questioning process helps connect new concepts to your existing prior knowledge, facilitating better comprehension and long-term retention.\n\nWhat is the main point the author is trying to convey?\nHow does this information relate to what I already know about the topic?\nWhat evidence or examples support the key arguments?\nDo I agree with the author’s perspective? Why or why not?\nAsking such questions keeps your mind engaged and encourages you to think more deeply about the material. This active reading approach, combined with prior knowledge activation, leads to a more thorough understanding compared to passive reading. With practice, active reading can become a habit that significantly enhances your reading comprehension skills.\n\nPassive Reading\tActive Reading\nSkimming without engaging\tQuestioning the content\nProne to mind-wandering\tMaintains focus and attention\nIsolated from prior knowledge\tConnects new ideas to existing understanding\nLimited comprehension\tDeeper understanding and retention\n7. Break Text into Chunks for Reading Comprehension\nWhen dealing with long or complex texts, it’s common to feel overwhelmed. To overcome this, try chunking the material into smaller, more manageable segments. This approach helps improve your reading stamina and keeps your focus sharp.\n\nText segmentation is a simple yet effective technique. It involves dividing the passage into logical sections. Focus on one paragraph or a few sentences at a time. After completing each chunk, take a brief pause to process the information before moving on.\n\n\nStep\tDescription\n1. Identify natural breaks\tLook for paragraph breaks, subheadings, or topic shifts\n2. Set a chunk size\tDetermine a manageable amount of text to focus on at once\n3. Read and pause\tRead each chunk carefully, then pause to process the information\n4. Summarize and connect\tBriefly summarize each chunk and link it to the overall context\nBy using this chunking strategy, you can tackle even the most challenging texts with ease. The goal is to break the reading into manageable pieces. This allows you to fully absorb and understand the material without feeling overwhelmed.\n\nBenefits of Text Segmentation\nImproves focus and concentration\nEnhances reading stamina\nIncreases comprehension and retention\nReduces feelings of overwhelm\nIncorporating chunking and text segmentation techniques into your reading routine can significantly boost your comprehension. It also makes the process more enjoyable. Give it a try and see how it can transform your reading experience!\n\n8. Revisit and Review\nTo truly grasp complex concepts and commit information to long-term memory, it’s essential to revisit and review the material you’ve read. Rereading challenging passages can provide clarity and deepen your understanding of the subject matter. By going over the text multiple times, you reinforce the connections between ideas and solidify your knowledge.\n\nOne effective review strategy is to create summaries of the key points covered in each section. Condensing the information into your own words helps you process and retain the material more effectively. You can also use mind maps, flashcards, or other visual aids to organize and review the concepts you’ve learned. Self-testing is another powerful technique for reinforcing your understanding and identifying areas that require further study.\n\nConsider implementing a structured review schedule to ensure you revisit the material at regular intervals. The following table illustrates a sample review plan:\n\nReview Interval\tActivities\nImmediately after reading\tSummarize key points, create mind maps\n24 hours later\tReview summaries, self-test with flashcards\n1 week later\tReread challenging sections, discuss with peers\n1 month later\tComprehensive review, integrate with new knowledge\nReinforce Your Learning\nBy consistently revisiting and reviewing the material, you reinforce your learning and create stronger neural connections in your brain. This process helps transfer information from short-term to long-term memory, making it easier to recall and apply the concepts when needed. Remember, effective reading comprehension is not just about understanding the text once, but also about internalizing the knowledge for future use.\n\n9. Discuss the Material\nEngaging in collaborative learning by discussing reading material with others is highly effective. Sharing insights and perspectives can reveal aspects you might have missed. This helps solidify your understanding of the subject.\n\nJoining discussion groups, whether in-person or online, offers a chance to delve deeper into the material. Through dialogue, you can expand your comprehension and gain insights from various viewpoints. This enriches your learning experience.\n\ncollaborative learning discussion\nKnowledge sharing is a significant advantage of discussing reading material. By exchanging ideas, you create a more comprehensive learning experience. This exchange can clarify complex concepts, reveal new connections, and strengthen your understanding.\n\nEngaging in Online Forums\nOnline forums are also valuable for discussing books and topics. These platforms connect readers globally, offering diverse perspectives and experiences. They are a treasure trove of insights.\n\nOnline Forum\tKey Features\nGoodreads\tBook reviews, discussions, and reading challenges\nReddit (r/books)\tDiverse discussions, recommendations, and AMAs with authors\nLibraryThing\tCatalog your books, connect with others, and join group discussions\nOnline communities provide a space to ask questions, share thoughts, and learn from others. This collaborative learning experience enhances your understanding and appreciation of the text.\n\n10. Use Technology to Support Reading Comprehension\nIn today’s digital age, technology offers numerous tools to enhance reading comprehension and make the process more engaging. By leveraging assistive technology, readers can overcome challenges and improve their understanding of complex texts.\n\nOne popular tool is text-to-speech software, which converts written text into audio format. This allows readers to listen to the material while following along visually, engaging multiple senses and reinforcing retention. Apps like The Listening App offer high-quality, natural-sounding voices and customizable reading speeds.\n\nAnother benefit of text-to-speech technology is the ability to multitask while reviewing material.

      "Summarize the following so suitable for age 8 to 12,  between 80 and 100 words, use headings for key time lines and sound informal, almost like gossip!\nNorman Colchester\nThe Medieval Period, or Middle Ages, lasted from the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century AD until around the 15th century. During this time Colchester saw an Anglo-Saxon settlement, Viking and Norman Invasion, and a thriving cloth and weaving industry become established. Colchester regained its position as one of the most important towns in the country, receiving its royal charter in 1189\n\nMany of Colchester's most notable and important historic buildings were built during this period, including Colchester Castle, St Botolph's Priory, St John's Abbey, as well as settlement in the Dutch Quarter and city centre in general.\n\n\nAnglo-Saxon Colchester\n \n\nFrom around AD 450 the Anglo Saxons started settling in England, but they seemed to have little interest in living in towns and is is thought the settlement at Colchester went into decline. Around AD 886 the town came under Viking control, but by AD917 they had been driven our by the Saxon king Edward the Elder. For the next 150 years the town flourished, although little remains in Colchester from this period, the notable exception to this rule is the impressive tower of Trinity Church with its distinctive Saxon arrowhead doorway, which dates back to this time.\n\n \nThe Normans in Colchester\n\nIn 1066 the Normans invaded, and with Colchester thriving they put the town under the protection of Eudo the Steward who began work on Colchester Castle in the late 1060s. Work also commenced on a number of significant religious foundations: St. Botolph's Priory, the first Augustinian house in England, and St John's Abbey. Today the impressive ruins of the great church at St Botolph's only hint at the scale of the medieval priory, while at St John's Abbey some long sections of the precinct wall and the later Tudor gatehouse survive. \n\nOlder than both the Castle and the Priory, St Helen's Chapel can be found in Colchester's historic Dutch Quarter. Like the Castle it is built on Roman foundations, however in the chapel's case on the corner of the Roman Theatre. Named after St Helena, the patron saint of Colchester, St Helen's Chapel is now home to the Greek Orthodox Church in Colchester and is usually open to look around.\n\n \n\nMedieval Colchester Today\n \nIn 1348 at least a quarter of Colchester's population died of the plague as the Black Death swept through Western Europe. The town not only survived the crisis but soon experienced a new golden age as trade recovered and the local cloth industry boomed.\n\nColchester Castle today is a museum displaying the riches of Colchester's past, within the walls of the largest Norman keep ever built. Colchester City Centre itself has many historic sites to explore, and you can download the Ancient Colchester App to see these sites comes to life.\n"

      "Using a sarcastic, know-it-all tone, please summarize the following text for me in two paragraphs totaling between 350-400 words and include some witty banter. Incorporate italic or bold text to really emphasize the snark. \n\nText: A 300-page iPhone bill from AT&T Mobility mailed in a box[1] was the subject of a viral video made by YouTube personality Justine Ezarik, best known as iJustine, which became an Internet meme in August 2007.[2][3][4] Ezarik's video focused on the unnecessary waste of paper, as the detailed bill itemized all data transfers made during the billing period, including every email and text message. Stories of unexpected billing issues began to circulate in blogs and the technical press after the iPhone's heavily advertised and anticipated release,[5][6] but this video clip brought the voluminous bills to the attention of the mass media.\n\nTen days later, after the video had been viewed more than 3 million times on the Internet[7][8] and had received international news coverage, AT&T sent iPhone users a text message outlining changes in its billing practices.[8][9] The information technology magazine Computerworld included this incident in its list of \"Technology's 10 Most Mortifying Moments\".[10][11]\n\nBackground\nApple released the iPhone in the United States with a software \"lock\" so it could only be used on the AT&T Mobility network.[12] After purchase, buyers activated their iPhone's AT&T service contract using the Apple iTunes software,[13] during which buyers had the ability to choose their billing preference; however, if no option was specified during activation AT&T defaulted to using detailed billing.[14] Detailed billing itemized every data transfer, including background traffic for e-mail, text messaging, and web browsing.[8] This generated a large number of entries.[5]\n\nAfter a month's time[15] as early adopters received their first monthly bills, stories of unusually large and expensive iPhone bills circulated. The 300-page bill was exceptional but other heavy users received 50- to 100-page bills.[16] One of the first to attract wider attention was from Ben Kuchera, gaming editor for the technology-related website Ars Technica, who described his 34-sheet, double-sided bill and another 104-page bill sent to a colleague;[5][6] he wrote, \"While many of us have had smart-phones for some time, we've never seen a bill like this.\"[17] However, it was the release of Justine Ezarik's video that acted as a catalyst to bring widespread media attention to this aspect of the iPhone story.[18]\n\nVideo\n\niJustine and her iPhone, in a case, in 2008\nJustine Ezarik, then a 23-year-old[18] Pittsburgh-area graphic designer and sketch comedian who video blogged with the name iJustine, received her 300-page bill on Saturday, August 11, 2007,[19] and decided to use it as a prop for a self-produced video shot in a coffee shop.[20] She posted the edited one-minute clip to several popular Internet video hosting services by the following Monday.[20] In the first week, the video received over 500,000 total views on YouTube, 350,000 views on Revver, 500,000 views on Break.com, and 1,100,000 views on Yahoo Video, as self-reported by the four popular Internet video sites as of August 22. Total views were reported to exceed 8 million by the end of 2007. Ezarik said she earned $2,000 from the video from Revver.[21]\n\nPortions of the video were also televised along with one-on-one interviews with Ezarik by several national and local news programs in the United States, including CNN,[22] Fox News Channel,[23] WTAE-TV,[20] and WPXI-TV.[24] ABC News Now also included independent reporting by an ABC News Radio reporter in their video interview.[25]\n\nEzarik's Internet video commentary focused on the unnecessary waste of paper billing. In the video she highlights the physical size of the bill, not the amount due. \"I have an iPhone and I had to switch to AT&T. So, that's wonderful. Well, I got my first AT&T bill, right here in a box,\" she says at the start of the video.[20] The rest of the video, set to the distinctive music used in American iPhone television commercials, shows her opening the box and flipping through the pages in fast motion.[26] The clip ends with the on-screen caption, \"Use e-billing. Save a forest.\"[5]\n\nHer other comments also followed along the same lines. In a blog posting she wrote, \"Apparently, they give you a detailed transaction of every text message sent and received. Completely unnecessary.\"[2] She told a USA Today reporter, \"This is so silly, there's no reason they need to send you this much information.\"[3] Ezarik is a heavy user who typically sends and receives tens of thousands of text messages a month, which generated an exceptionally long $275[3] bill – 300 double-sided pages that had to be sent in a box with postage charges of $7.[27]\n\nReaction\n\nThe original iPhone\nCompany\nAT&T Mobility, the mobile phone service provider for the iPhone said through spokesman Mark Siegel that the size of this bill was exceptional. \"We're not sending lots of boxed bills to customers,\" he told USA Today. He said that the billing is the same for all AT&T mobile users, but the popularity and functionality of the iPhone gave it new visibility. \"It's no different than with any other bill for any other device or any other service that we offer.\"[5]\n\nLater, on August 18, AT&T issued a statement saying: \"Our customers have the option of receiving a bill that is detail-free. Also, we have for years encouraged our customers to switch to online billing because it is convenient, secure, and environmentally friendly.\"[28] Then, on August 22, AT&T announced via text message to iPhone users that it was removing itemized detail from paper bills.[8][9] Ezarik responded, \"Looks like they may have got the message,\" in response to AT&T's action.[8] Company spokeswoman Lauren Garner claimed public reaction was not the reason for the company's switch from detailed to summary billing, saying, \"This was something we planned all along.\"[26][29]\n\nIndustry\nAT&T may not have anticipated the downstream effects of iPhone customers' high data usage.[30][31]\n\nInternet reporter Dana Blankenhorn stated that the size of the bill illustrated a problem with the telephone companies' \"event based\" or connection-oriented business model and used it to argue for open spectrum in a radio frequency spectrum auction in the U.S. scheduled for 2008. He contrasted how telephone billing considers every action a separately billable event, while the Internet model is based on a flat fee for best-effort delivery in connectionless mode transmission.[32]\n\nThe information technology magazine Computerworld reported on the incident, saying the company's \"extraordinarily detailed billing process resulted in some users receiving bills that ran dozens or even hundreds of pages long.\" It published the gaffe in its list of \"Technology's 10 Most Mortifying Moments\".[10][11]\n\nEnvironmental\nRob Enderle, a Silicon Valley tech analyst also echoed Ezarik's environmental activism, saying, \"AT&T should get a new tagline – use AT&T, kill a tree.\"[27] The USA Today story was also titled \"How many trees did your iPhone bill kill?\"[3] According to blogger Muhammad Saleem, Apple's aim to have 10 million iPhone users by the end of 2008 would require the logging of about 74,535 trees annually, assuming an average 100-page monthly bill.[26][33][34] An editorial in The Blade, an independent newspaper in Toledo, Ohio called the detailed billing \"absurd and environmentally wasteful\".[35]\n\nSecurity\nOne security conscious commenter on the Engadget consumer electronics blog addressed the privacy implications of the oversize bills given the limitations of personal paper shredders, by speculating on whether it would be easier to dispose of these large bills by burning them to protect personal information.[36] An editor for the libertarian monthly Reason also speculated about the usefulness of the detailed information to government investigators.[37] The original Ars Technica blog posting, on the other hand, dismissed privacy concerns, showing that the detail pages do not contain sensitive information.[38]\n\nOther outsized iPhone bills\nPress accounts of this story also included related details and comments:\n\nThe founder of a Tampa, Florida think tank received a 42-page bill and told a reporter, \"It's ridiculous.\"[39]\nAn Oak Harbor, Ohio teacher called his 52-page bill \"the biggest phone bill I've ever gotten in my life\".[3]\nA partner of a Macintosh consulting firm called his bill \"60 pages of nothingness\".[40]\nA business consultant from Virginia received a 62-page bill and asked a reporter, \"Why would you send bills that large?\"[41]\nA software company owner near Seattle, Washington posted on his blog a picture of a Maltese dog sitting on his 127-page bill spread out on the floor.[7][8] and asked, \"Has anyone on the Apple Environmental Team seen an AT&T bill?\"[42]\n\"The Packet Rat\" columnist wrote in Government Computer News that his wife received a 150-page boxed iPhone bill and commented, \"OK, how many trees did they have to kill to send out the first month's bills?\"[43]"

Even though he was unable to wash his lush mane in the river, there was no stopping him from getting it clean. The rain rinsed his mane and once satisfied that it was clean, Phil went back under the tree to wait out the storm. Phil quite enjoyed watching the storm and the lightning bolts in the distance.

They infiltrate Hangar 51 in Nevada and use Jones to locate a mummified alien from the Roswell incident. Jones locates the mummy before being double-crossed by Mac, but escapes to a nearby model town at the Nevada Test Site, minutes before an atomic bomb test. He survives the blast in a lead-lined refrigerator in one of the town's mock houses before being rescued and interrogated by the FBI.\n\nReturning to Marshall College, Jones discovers he has been placed on an indefinite leave of absence. Mutt Williams, a young greaser, approaches Jones and informs him that his former colleague, Harold \"Ox\" Oxley, found a crystal skull in Peru in search of the mythical city Akator. Soviet agents attempt to capture them, but the two escape and travel to Peru. There, they find carvings made by Ox which lead the pair to the grave of Francisco de Orellana, which contains an elongated crystal skull. Leaving the grave, the two are captured by the Soviets and taken to a camp in the Amazon rainforest. They are reunited with Mac, Spalko, an addled Ox, and Mutt's mother, Marion Ravenwood, who informs Jones that Mutt is his son. Spalko tells Jones that the skulls are alien in origin and intends to use them to project Soviet propaganda into the minds of Americans. Jones has a brief telepathic connection to the skull, which commands him to return it to Akator. Jones realizes that Ox is attempting to communicate through automatic writing, discovering a route to the city.\n\nWhile en route to Akator, Jones retakes the skull from the Soviets and escapes from them alongside Marion, Ox, Mutt and Mac, who claims to be a double agent, all the while leaving a trail for Spalko. Jones and his companions locate Akator, where they learn that the skull belonged to one of thirteen \"interdimensional beings\" whom the early Ugha tribes worshipped as deities. Spalko catches up and returns the skull to its skeleton, which comes to life and offers Spalko the reward of omniscience. As an interdimensional portal opens above the chamber, abducting Mac and Spalko’s remaining soldiers, the skeletons combine into a reanimated alien, who transfers an overwhelming amount of knowledge into Spalko's mind, vaporizing her. Jones, Ox, Marion and Mutt escape the crumbling city as a flying saucer rises from the ruins and departs for another dimension.

      "Prescott’s new four-year, $240 million deal was completed hours before the Cowboys kicked off their season against the Cleveland Browns. The deal set an NFL record for average annual salary of $60 million, a major step up from the $55 million-a-year deals for fellow quarterbacks Burrow, Love and Trevor Lawrence. In addition, the $231 million in guaranteed money was a tick ahead of the $230 million the Browns gave QB Deshaun Watson in 2022—a deal that is drawing scrutiny once again after new sexual assault allegations.\n\nPrescott now has two of the five largest signing bonuses in NFL history, including the $66 million he received in 2021. The biggest NFL deals traditionally include large signing bonuses, which was the case this year for Love ($75 million), Goff ($73 million) and Kirk Cousins ($50 million). Brian Burns ($43.9 million) is the line defender.\n\nPrescott's role as QB for America's Team makes him a popular pitchman. His partners include Nike's Jordan Brand, Lowe's, Beats, AT&T and Albertsons.\n\nCan you extract the NFL players and their salaries? Make it a list."

      "\"The knight-errant is a character who has broken away from the world of his origin, in order to go off on his own to right wrongs or to test and assert his own chivalric ideals. In medieval Europe, knight-errantry existed in literature, though fictional works from this time often were presented as non-fiction.\n\nThe template of the knight-errant were the heroes of the Round Table of the Arthurian cycle such as Gawain, Lancelot, and Percival. The quest par excellence in pursuit of which these knights wandered the lands is that of the Holy Grail, such as in Perceval, the Story of the Grail written by Chrétien de Troyes in the 1180s.\n\nThe character of the wandering knight existed in romantic literature as it developed during the late 12th century. However, the term \"knight-errant\" was to come later; its first extant usage occurs in the 14th-century poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. Knight-errantry tales remained popular with courtly audiences throughout the Late Middle Ages. They were written in Middle French, Middle English, and Middle German.\n\nIn the 16th century, the genre became highly popular in the Iberian Peninsula; Amadis de Gaula was one of the most successful knight-errantry tales of this period. In Don Quixote (1605), Miguel de Cervantes burlesqued the romances and their popularity. Tales of knight-errantry then fell out of fashion for two centuries, until they re-emerged in the form of the historical novel in Romanticism.\"\n\nExtract all of the dates/time periods mentioned in this text."

However, it was Murphy who stole the show.\n\nShe created City's opener with a clever bit of wing play, beating Aoife Mannion to the byline before firing in a low cross that Laura Coombs swept past Phallon Tullis-Joyce at the near post.\n\nCity looked comfortable but were pegged back 10 minutes before the break when Turner took down a cross before swivelling and firing pas Keating from close range.\n\nJust as the half was petering out, Murphy scored with a stunning effort. The teenager cut inside past Mannion - a theme of the evening - and curled a strike in off the far post, her second senior goal for the club.\n\nThe introduction of Elisabeth Terland early in the second half injected fresh impetus into United's attacks, but the Norwegian striker volleyed wide when gifted a chance to equalise.\n\nCity goalkeeper Keating looked more assured than she did on Sunday, although she was perhaps fortunate to not concede a penalty in the final 10 minutes when she collided with Terland when coming for a through ball. The 20-year-old came off second-best and was replaced by Ayaka Yamashita.\n\nSemi-final draw\nManchester City v Arsenal\n\nWest Ham v Chelsea\n\nMariona Caldentey scored once and assisted twice against Brighton\n\nArsenal scored three goals in a frantic five minutes to set up a 4-0 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion.\n\nThe holders were frustrated for 65 minutes by Brighton's determined defensive performance before substitute Mariona Caldentey changed the game, pouncing on a loose pass from goalkeeper Melina Loeck to set up Frida Maanum's opener.\n\nAnother Brighton error allowed Katie McCabe to double Arsenal's lead three minutes later before Caldentey turned provider once again, teeing up Kyra Cooney-Cross, who curled home a rocket from outside the box.\n\nCaldentey deservedly put the icing on the cake with a stylish lob in the 83rd minute, extending Arsenal's unbeaten run under head coach Renee Slegers to 13 matches.\n\n\nChelsea, who were beaten 1-0 by Arsenal in last year's final, put on a ruthless second-half display to overcome Championship side Durham 5-0.\n\nDurham, the lowest-ranked side left in the competition, held their own for the first 45 minutes and went into the break only 1-0 down, having conceded to an Aggie Beever-Jones header.\n\nBut after Oriane Jean-Francois doubled the hosts' lead with the pick of the goals - an impressive volley from the edge of the box - Chelsea scored another three in four second-half minutes through Erin Cuthbert, Guro Reiten and Maika Hamano to put the game out of sight.\n\n\nWest Ham went out in the group stages of last season's Women's League Cup\n\nWest Ham staged a first-half comeback to beat Tottenham 2-1 and set up a Women's League Cup semi-final against London rivals Chelsea.\n\nSpurs took the lead through Martha Thomas, who guided her header expertly past Eleanor Heeps on 10 minutes.

Feige said some of the MCU was changed to \"accommodate this version\" of the film, as that version \"helped to dictate what we did with the roster for Avengers the first time. It was a bit of both in terms of his idea for the Ant-Man story influencing the birth of the MCU in the early films leading up to Avengers.\"[26] In June 2023, the distribution rights to The Incredible Hulk reverted from Universal back to Marvel Studios and Disney.[27][28] Marvel Studios started using phrases like \"Phase One\" because Feige did not want to refer to the films as names like Iron Man trilogy or Thor trilogy. The Phase idea came from the comics, with Feige saying \"individual characters would occasionally come together for a mega-event limited series\". As a result, the plan became to do a Phase and then end it with an Avengers film.'"

      "Extract the names of people including their titles:\n\nThe people heard of the attempt on the King’s life with transports of fury, and with the greatest distress. Their cries were heard under the windows of Madame de Pompadour’s apartment. Mobs were collected, and Madame feared the fate of Madame de Chateauroux. Her friends came in, every minute, to give her intelligence. Her room was, at all times, like a church; everybody seemed to claim a right to go in and out when he chose. Some came, under pretence of sympathising, to observe her countenance and manner. She did nothing but weep and faint away. Doctor Quesnay never left her, nor did I. M. de St. Florentin came to see her several times, so did the Comptroller-General, and M. Rouilld; but M. de Machault did not come. The Duchesse de Brancas came very frequently. The Abbe de Bernis never left us, except to go to enquire for the King. The tears came in his eyes whenever he looked at Madame. Doctor Quesnay saw the King five or six times a day. “There is nothing to fear,” said he to Madame. “If it were anybody else, he might go to a ball.” My son went the next day, as he had done the day the event occurred, to see what was going on at the Castle. He told us, on his return, that the Keeper of the Seals was with the King. I sent him back, to see what course he took on leaving the King. He came running back in half an hour, to tell me that the Keeper of the Seals had gone to his own house, followed by a crowd of people. When I told this to Madame, she burst into tears, and said, “Is that a friend?” The Abbe de Bernis said, “You must not judge him hastily, in such a moment as this.” I returned into the drawing-room about an hour after, when the Keeper of the Seals entered. He passed me, with his usual cold and severe look. “How is Madame de Pompadour?” said he. “Alas!” replied I, “as you may imagine!” He passed on to her closet. Everybody retired, and he remained for half an hour. The Abbe returned and Madame rang. I went into her room, the Abbe following me. She was in tears. “I must go, my dear Abbe,” said she. I made her take some orange-flower water, in a silver goblet, for her teeth chattered. She then told me to call her equerry. He came in, and she calmly gave him her orders, to have everything prepared at her hotel, in Paris; to tell all her people to get ready to go; and to desire her coachman not to be out of the way. She then shut herself up, to confer with the Abbe de Bernis, who left her, to go to the Council. Her door was then shut, except to the ladies with whom she was particularly intimate, M. de Soubise, M. de Gontaut, the Ministers, and some others. Several ladies, in the greatest distress, came to talk to me in my room: they compared the conduct of M. de Machault with that of M. de Richelieu, at Metz. Madame had related to them the circumstances extremely to the honour of the Duke, and, by contrast, the severest satire on the Keeper of the Seals. “He thinks, or pretends to think,” said she, “that the priests will be clamorous for my dismissal; but Quesnay and all the physicians declare that there is not the slightest danger.” Madame having sent for me, I saw the Marechale de Mirepoix coming in. While she was at the door, she cried out, “What are all those trunks, Madame? Your people tell me you are going.”—“Alas! my dear friend, such is our Master’s desire, as M. de Machault tells me.”—“And what does he advise?” said the Marechale. “That I should go without delay.” During this conversation, I was undressing Madame, who wished to be at her ease on her chaise-longue. “Your Beeper of the Seals wants to get the power into his own hands, and betrays you; he who quits the field loses it.” I went out. M. de Soubise entered, then the Abbe and M. de Marigny. The latter, who was very kind to me, came into my room an hour afterwards. I was alone. “She will remain,” said he; “but, hush!—she will make an appearance of going, in order not to set her enemies at work. It is the little Marechale who prevailed upon her to stay: her keeper (so she called M. de Machault) will pay for it.” Quesnay came in, and, having heard what was said, with his monkey airs, began to relate a fable of a fox, who, being at dinner with other beasts, persuaded one of them that his enemies were seeking him, in order that he might get possession of his share in his absence. I did not see Madame again till very late, at her going to bed. She was more calm. Things improved, from day to day, and de Machault, the faithless friend, was dismissed. The King returned to Madame de Pompadour, as usual. I learnt, by M. de Marigny, that the Abbe had been, one day, with M. d’Argenson, to endeavour to persuade him to live on friendly terms with Madame, and that he had been very coldly received. “He is the more arrogant,” said he, “on account of Machault’s dismissal, which leaves the field clear for him, who has more experience, and more talent; and I fear that he will, therefore, be disposed to declare war till death.” The next day, Madame having ordered her chaise, I was curious to know where she was going, for she went out but little, except to church, and to the houses of the Ministers. I was told that she was gone to visit M. d’Argenson. She returned in an hour, at farthest, and seemed very much out of spirits. She leaned on the chimneypiece, with her eyes fixed on the border of it. M. de Bernis entered. I waited for her to take off her cloak and gloves. She had her hands in her muff. The Abbe stood looking at her for some minutes; at last he said, “You look like a sheep in a reflecting mood.” She awoke from her reverie, and, throwing her muff on the easy-chair, replied, “It is a wolf who makes the sheep reflect.” I went out: the King entered shortly after, and I heard Madame de Pompadour sobbing. The Abbe came into my room, and told me to bring some Hoffman’s drops: the King himself mixed the draught with sugar, and presented it to her in the kindest manner possible. She smiled, and kissed the King’s hands. I left the room. Two days after, very early in the morning, I heard of M. d’Argenson’s exile. It was her doing, and was, indeed, the strongest proof of her influence that could be given. The King was much attached to M. d’Argenson, and the war, then carrying on, both by sea and land, rendered the dismissal of two such Ministers extremely imprudent. This was the universal opinion at the time."

      "Can you please return all of the character names mentioned in the story below?\n\n\"ONE SUNNY SPRING DAY, Caterpillar was out for a walk in the woods and came upon a cave entrance.  “Will you look at that!” said Caterpillar. “I must say, this looks like a very nice cave.”  Caterpillar peaked in.  “I don't see anyone in there,” he said.  “Maybe I'll just go inside.” So Caterpillar inched inside the cave.\n\nCaterpillar crawled up on the top of a rock and immediately fell asleep.  Now at this very moment, Hare, who actually lived in the cave, was returning home from a walk of his own. Hare noticed marks on the ground that led to inside his cave.  At once, he realized what had happened.  Alarmed, he called out, \"Who is in my cave? Answer me!\" \n\nThis woke up Caterpillar.  Caterpillar boomed out in a very loud voice, “It is I! Yes, I who crushes rhinos to the earth and who stomps elephants into dust!”  Hare hopped about in fear. “What can a small animal like me do with a beast who crushes rhinos to the earth and stomps elephants into dust?”\n\nSoon Jackal passed by.  Hare said, “Friend Jackal, won't you help me, please?  Some fearsome beast has taken over my cave!  Won't you talk to it and get it to come out?”\n\nJackal said with confidence, “Of course!  All creatures large and small listen to ME.”  Jackal stepped boldly to the cave and barked, “Who is in the house of my friend, the Hare? Come out at once!”\n\nCaterpillar called out in a voice that rocked the earth, “It is I! Yes, I who crushes rhinos to the earth, and stomps elephants into dust!”\n\nOn hearing this, Jackal thought in fear, “I can do nothing against such a creature!”  Before Hare could say a word, Jackal had dashed into the bushes.\n\nThen Leopard passed by.  Hare frantically told Leopard everything that had happened, and begged Leopard to help.  Leopard said, “That's no problem at all!  I'm bigger than Jackal and louder, too.”  At the door of the cave, Leopard bared her claws and growled a terrible growl. “Who is in the house of my friend Hare?”  Caterpillar called back in the same way he had done before.\""

      "Extract verbs from the article below. Include only verbs ending in -ing and starting with the letter s.\n\nFreedom of speech is a principle that supports the freedom of an individual or a community to articulate their opinions and ideas without fear of retaliation, censorship, or legal sanction. The right to freedom of expression has been recognised as a human right in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international human rights law. Many countries have constitutional law that protects free speech. Terms like free speech, freedom of speech, and freedom of expression are used interchangeably in political discourse. However, in a legal sense, the freedom of expression includes any activity of seeking, receiving, and imparting information or ideas, regardless of the medium used.\n\nArticle 19 of the UDHR states that \"everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference\" and \"everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice\". The version of Article 19 in the ICCPR later amends this by stating that the exercise of these rights carries \"special duties and responsibilities\" and may \"therefore be subject to certain restrictions\" when necessary \"[f]or respect of the rights or reputation of others\" or \"[f]or the protection of national security or public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals\".[2]\n\nFreedom of speech and expression, therefore, may not be recognized as being absolute, and common limitations or boundaries to freedom of speech relate to libel, slander, obscenity, pornography, sedition, incitement, fighting words, hate speech, classified information, copyright violation, trade secrets, food labeling, non-disclosure agreements, the right to privacy, dignity, the right to be forgotten, public security, blasphemy and perjury. Justifications for such include the harm principle, proposed by John Stuart Mill in On Liberty, which suggests that \"the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others\".[3]\n\nThe idea of the \"offense principle\" is also used to justify speech limitations, describing the restriction on forms of expression deemed offensive to society, considering factors such as extent, duration, motives of the speaker, and ease with which it could be avoided.[3] With the evolution of the digital age, application of freedom of speech becomes more controversial as new means of communication and restrictions arise, for example, the Golden Shield Project, an initiative by Chinese government's Ministry of Public Security that filters potentially unfavourable data from foreign countries. Facebook routinely and automatically eliminates what it perceives as hate speech, even if such words are used ironically or poetically with no intent to insult others.\n\nHistorical origins\nFreedom of speech and expression has a long history that predates modern international human rights instruments.[4] It is thought that the ancient Athenian democratic principle of free speech may have emerged in the late 6th or early 5th century BC.[5]\n\nFreedom of speech was vindicated by Erasmus and Milton.[4] Edward Coke claimed freedom of speech as \"an ancient custom of Parliament\" in the 1590s, and it was affirmed in the Protestation of 1621.[6] Restating what is written in the English Declaration of Right, 1689, England's Bill of Rights 1689 legally established the constitutional right of freedom of speech in Parliament, which is still in effect.[7][8] This so-called parliamentary privilege includes no possible defamation claims meaning Parliamentarians are free to speak up in the House without fear of legal action.[9] This protection extends to written proceedings: for example, written and oral questions, motions and amendments tabled to bills and motions.[9]\n\nOne of the world's first freedom of the press acts was introduced in Sweden in 1766 (Swedish Freedom of the Press Act), mainly due to the classical liberal member of parliament and Ostrobothnian priest Anders Chydenius.[10][11][12][13] In a report published in 1776, he wrote:[14]\n\nNo evidence should be needed that a certain freedom of writing and printing is one of the strongest bulwarks of a free organization of the state, as, without it, the estates would not have sufficient information for the drafting of good laws, and those dispensing justice would not be monitored, nor would the subjects know the requirements of the law, the limits of the rights of government, and their responsibilities. Education and ethical conduct would be crushed; coarseness in thought, speech, and manners would prevail, and dimness would darken the entire sky of our freedom in a few years.\n\nUnder the leadership of Anders Chydenius, the Caps at the Swedish Riksdag in Gävle on December 2, 1766, passed the adoption of a freedom of the press regulation that stopped censorship and introduced the principle of public access to official records in Sweden. Excluded were defamation of the king's majesty and the Swedish Church.\n\nThe Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, adopted during the French Revolution in 1789, specifically affirmed freedom of speech as an inalienable right.[4] Adopted in 1791, freedom of speech is a feature of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.[15] The French Declaration provides for freedom of expression in Article 11, which states that:\n\nThe free communication of ideas and opinions is one of the most precious of the rights of man. Every citizen may, accordingly, speak, write, and print with freedom, but shall be responsible for such abuses of this freedom as shall be defined by law.[16]\n\nArticle 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948, states that:\n\nEveryone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.[17]\n\nToday, freedom of speech, or the freedom of expression, is recognised in international and regional human rights law. The right is enshrined in Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, Article 13 of the American Convention on Human Rights and Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights.[18] Based on John Milton's arguments, freedom of speech is understood as a multi-faceted right that includes not only the right to express, or disseminate, information and ideas but three further distinct aspects:\n\nthe right to seek information and ideas;\nthe right to receive information and ideas;\nthe right to impart information and ideas\nInternational, regional and national standards also recognise that freedom of speech, as the freedom of expression, includes any medium, whether orally, in writing, in print, through the internet or art forms. This means that the protection of freedom of speech as a right includes the content and the means of expression.[18]\n\nRelationship to other rights\nThe right to freedom of speech and expression is closely related to other rights. It may be limited when conflicting with other rights (see limitations on freedom of speech).[18] The right to freedom of expression is also related to the right to a fair trial and court proceeding which may limit access to the search for information, or determine the opportunity and means in which freedom of expression is manifested within court proceedings.[19] As a general principle freedom of expression may not limit the right to privacy, as well as the honor and reputation of others. However, greater latitude is given when criticism of public figures is involved.[19]\n\nThe right to freedom of expression is particularly important for media, which play a special role as the bearer of the general right to freedom of expression for all.[18] However, freedom of the press does not necessarily enable freedom of speech. Judith Lichtenberg has outlined conditions in which freedom of the press may constrain freedom of speech. For example, if all the people who control the various mediums of publication suppress information or stifle the diversity of voices inherent in freedom of speech. This limitation was famously summarised as \"Freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one\".[20] Lichtenberg argues that freedom of the press is simply a form of property right summed up by the principle \"no money, no voice\".[21]\n\nAs a negative right\nFreedom of speech is usually seen as a negative right.[22] This means that the government is legally obliged to take no action against the speaker based on the speaker's views, but that no one is obliged to help any speakers publish their views, and no one is required to listen to, agree with, or acknowledge the speaker or the speaker's views. These concepts correspond to earlier traditions of natural law and common law rights.[23]\n\nDemocracy in relation to social interaction\n\nPermanent Free Speech Wall in Charlottesville, Virginia, U.S.\nFreedom of speech is understood to be fundamental in a democracy. The norms on limiting freedom of expression mean that public debate may not be completely suppressed even in times of emergency.[19] One of the most notable proponents of the link between freedom of speech and democracy is Alexander Meiklejohn. He has argued that the concept of democracy is that of self-government by the people. For such a system to work, an informed electorate is necessary. In order to be appropriately knowledgeable, there must be no constraints on the free flow of information and ideas. According to Meiklejohn, democracy will not be true to its essential ideal if those in power can manipulate the electorate by withholding information and stifling criticism. Meiklejohn acknowledges that the desire to manipulate opinion can stem from the motive of seeking to benefit society. However, he argues, choosing manipulation negates, in its means, the democratic ideal.[24]\n\nEric Barendt has called this defence of free speech on the grounds of democracy \"probably the most attractive and certainly the most fashionable free speech theory in modern Western democracies\".[25] Thomas I. Emerson expanded on this defence when he argued that freedom of speech helps to provide a balance between stability and change. Freedom of speech acts as a \"safety valve\" to let off steam when people might otherwise be bent on revolution. He argues that \"The principle of open discussion is a method of achieving a more adaptable and at the same time more stable community, of maintaining the precarious balance between healthy cleavage and necessary consensus\". Emerson furthermore maintains that \"Opposition serves a vital social function in offsetting or ameliorating (the) normal process of bureaucratic decay\".[26]\n\nResearch undertaken by the Worldwide Governance Indicators project at the World Bank, indicates that freedom of speech, and the process of accountability that follows it, have a significant impact on the quality of governance of a country. \"Voice and Accountability\" within a country, defined as \"the extent to which a country's citizens are able to participate in selecting their government, as well as freedom of expression, freedom of association, and free media\" is one of the six dimensions of governance that the Worldwide Governance Indicators measure for more than 200 countries.[27] Against this backdrop it is important that development agencies create grounds for effective support for a free press in developing countries.[28]\n\nRichard Moon has developed the argument that the value of freedom of speech and freedom of expression lies with social interactions. Moon writes that \"by communicating an individual forms relationships and associations with others – family, friends, co-workers, church congregation, and countrymen. By entering into discussion with others an individual participates in the development of knowledge and in the direction of the community\".[29]\n\nThe Human Rights Measurement Initiative[30] measures the right to opinion and expression for countries around the world, using a survey of in-country human rights experts.[31]\n\nLimitations\nFor specific country examples, see Freedom of speech by country and Criminal speech.\n\nLaws of holocaust denial 2022[32]\nFreedom of speech is not regarded as absolute by some, with most legal systems generally setting limits on the freedom of speech, particularly when freedom of speech conflicts with other rights and protections, such as in the cases of libel, slander, pornography, obscenity, fighting words, and intellectual property.\n\nSome limitations to freedom of speech may occur through legal sanction, and others may occur through social disapprobation.[33] In Saudi Arabia, journalists are forbidden to write with disrespect or disapproval of the royal family, religion, or the government. Journalists are also not given any legal protection for their writing in Saudi Arabia. Journalist Jamal Khashoggi was a critic of the Saudi Arabian government. He was killed in 2018 by Saudi Arabian officials for his writing.\n\nContent viewed as harmful and offensive\nSome views are illegal to express because they are perceived by some to be harmful to others. This category often includes speech that is both false and potentially dangerous, such as falsely shouting \"Fire!\" in a theatre and causing a panic. Justifications for limitations to freedom of speech often reference the \"harm principle\" or the \"offence principle\".\n\nIn On Liberty (1859), John Stuart Mill argued that \"...there ought to exist the fullest liberty of professing and discussing, as a matter of ethical conviction, any doctrine, however immoral it may be considered\".[33] Mill argues that the fullest liberty of expression is required to push arguments to their logical limits, rather than the limits of social embarrassment.[34][35][36][37]\n\nIn 1985, Joel Feinberg introduced what is known as the \"offence principle\". Feinberg wrote, \"It is always a good reason in support of a proposed criminal prohibition that it would probably be an effective way of preventing serious offence (as opposed to injury or harm) to persons other than the actor, and that it is probably a necessary means to that end\".[38] Hence Feinberg argues that the harm principle sets the bar too high and that some forms of expression can be legitimately prohibited by law because they are very offensive. Nevertheless, as offending someone is less serious than harming someone, the penalties imposed should be higher for causing harm.[38] In contrast, Mill does not support legal penalties unless they are based on the harm principle.[33] Because the degree to which people may take offence varies, or may be the result of unjustified prejudice, Feinberg suggests that several factors need to be taken into account when applying the offence principle, including: the extent, duration and social value of the speech, the ease with which it can be avoided, the motives of the speaker, the number of people offended, the intensity of the offence, and the general interest of the community at large.[33]\n\nJasper Doomen argued that harm should be defined from the point of view of the individual citizen, not limiting harm to physical harm since nonphysical harm may also be involved; Feinberg's distinction between harm and offence is criticized as largely trivial.[39]\n\nIn 1999, Bernard Harcourt wrote of the collapse of the harm principle: \"Today the debate is characterized by a cacophony of competing harm arguments without any way to resolve them. There is no longer an argument within the structure of the debate to resolve the competing claims of harm. The original harm principle was never equipped to determine the relative importance of harms\".[40]\n\nInterpretations of both the harm and offense limitations to freedom of speech are culturally and politically relative. For instance, in Russia, the harm and offense principles have been used to justify the Russian LGBT propaganda law restricting speech (and action) concerning LGBT issues. Many European countries outlaw speech that might be interpreted as Holocaust denial. These include Austria, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Slovakia, Switzerland and Romania.[41] Armenian genocide denial is also illegal in some countries.\n\n\nRestriction of apostasy by country (2020)[42]\nApostasy has been instrumentalized to restrict freedom of speech in some countries.[43] In some countries, blasphemy is a crime. For example, in Austria, defaming Muhammad, the prophet of Islam, is not protected as free speech.[44][45][46] In contrast, in France, blasphemy and disparagement of Muhammad are protected under free speech law.\n\nCertain public institutions may also enact policies restricting the freedom of speech, for example, speech codes at state-operated schools.\n\nIn the U.S., the standing landmark opinion on political speech is Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969),[47] expressly overruling Whitney v. California.[48] In Brandenburg, the U.S. Supreme Court referred to the right even to speak openly of violent action and revolution in broad terms:\n\n[Our] decisions have fashioned the principle that the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not allow a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or cause such action.[49]\n\nThe opinion in Brandenburg discarded the previous test of \"clear and present danger\" and made the right to freedom of (political) speech protections in the United States almost absolute.[50][51] Hate speech is also protected by the First Amendment in the United States, as decided in R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, (1992) in which the Supreme Court ruled that hate speech is permissible, except in the case of imminent violence.[52] The First Amendment to the United States Constitution contains more detailed information on the Supreme Court decision and its historical background.[53][54][55]\n\nTime, place and manner\nMain article: Time, place and manner\nLimitations based on time, place, and manner apply to all speech, regardless of the view expressed.[56] They are generally restrictions that are intended to balance other rights or a legitimate government interest. For example, a time, place, and manner restriction might prohibit a noisy political demonstration at a politician's home during the middle of the night, as that impinges upon the rights of the politician's neighbors to quiet enjoyment of their own homes. An otherwise identical activity might be permitted if it happened at a different time (e.g., during the day), at a different place (e.g., at a government building or in another public forum), or in a different manner (e.g., a silent protest). Funeral Protests are a complex issue in the United States. It is a right to Americans to be able to hold a peaceful protest against various policies they deem unreasonable. It is a question of whether or not it is appropriate through the time, place and manner outlook to protest funeral proceedings. Because of recent flare ups of this occurring, legislation has been put to action to limit this. Now, funeral protests are governed and prohibited by law on a state-to-state basis inside the United States.\n\nThe Internet and information society\n\nThe Free Speech Flag was created during the AACS encryption key controversy as \"a symbol to show support for personal freedoms\".[57]\nJo Glanville, editor of the Index on Censorship, states that \"the Internet has been a revolution for censorship as much as for free speech\".[58] International, national and regional standards recognise that freedom of speech, as one form of freedom of expression, applies to any medium, including the Internet.[18] The Communications Decency Act (CDA) of 1996 was the first major attempt by the United States Congress to regulate pornographic material on the Internet. In 1997, in the landmark cyberlaw case of Reno v. ACLU, the US Supreme Court partially overturned the law.[59] Judge Stewart R. Dalzell, one of the three federal judges who in June 1996 declared parts of the CDA unconstitutional, in his opinion stated the following:[60]\n\nThe Internet is a far more speech-enhancing medium than print, the village green, or the mails. Because it would necessarily affect the Internet itself, the CDA would necessarily reduce the speech available for adults on the medium. This is a constitutionally intolerable result. Some of the dialogue on the Internet surely tests the limits of conventional discourse. Speech on the Internet can be unfiltered, unpolished, and unconventional, even emotionally charged, sexually explicit, and vulgar – in a word, \"indecent\" in many communities. But we should expect such speech to occur in a medium in which citizens from all walks of life have a voice. We should also protect the autonomy that such a medium confers to ordinary people as well as media magnates.[...] My analysis does not deprive the Government of all means of protecting children from the dangers of Internet communication. The Government can continue to protect children from pornography on the Internet through vigorous enforcement of existing laws criminalising obscenity and child pornography. [...] As we learned at the hearing, there is also a compelling need for public educations about the benefits and dangers of this new medium, and the Government can fill that role as well. In my view, our action today should only mean that Government's permissible supervision of Internet contents stops at the traditional line of unprotected speech. [...] The absence of governmental regulation of Internet content has unquestionably produced a kind of chaos, but as one of the plaintiff's experts put it with such resonance at the hearing: \"What achieved success was the very chaos that the Internet is. The strength of the Internet is chaos.\" Just as the strength of the Internet is chaos, so that strength of our liberty depends upon the chaos and cacophony of the unfettered speech the First Amendment protects.[60]\n\nThe World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) Declaration of Principles adopted in 2003 makes specific reference to the importance of the right to freedom of expression for the \"Information Society\" in stating:\n\nWe reaffirm, as an essential foundation of the Information society, and as outlined in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; that this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. Communication is a fundamental social process, a basic human need and the foundation of all social organisation. It is central to the Information Society. Everyone, everywhere should have the opportunity to participate and no one should be excluded from the benefits of the Information Society offers.[61]\n\nAccording to Bernt Hugenholtz and Lucie Guibault, the public domain is under pressure from the \"commodification of information\" as information with previously little or no economic value has acquired independent economic value in the information age. This includes factual data, personal data, genetic information and pure ideas. The commodification of information is taking place through intellectual property law, contract law, as well as broadcasting and telecommunications law.[62]"

Give each section a bolded heading. \n\nVegan Chocolate Orange Loaf Cake\nJump to Recipe\nSuper light, fluffy and deliciously moist, no one will believe you that this Vegan Chocolate Orange Loaf Cake is actually vegan!\n\nVegan Chocolate Orange Loaf Cake\nWhat are vegan cakes?\nIn case you aren’t aware, vegan cakes are made without eggs, dairy butter or dairy milk.\n\nThe butter and milk can easily be replaced by dairy free alternatives. However there are lots of options to replace the eggs.\n\nVeganism has become a lot more widespread in the last few years and you can easily buy vegan cakes in supermarkets. But as with most cakes, they taste far better if you bake your own.\n\nVegan cakes are delicious!\nIf you are vegan you don’t need me to tell you this, you already know! Before I’d given vegan baking a try, I was very sceptical.\n\nI didn’t know what the taste would be like and whether the texture would be different to the baking I was used to. \n\nThis Vegan Chocolate Orange Loaf Cake was my first attempt at vegan baking. Obviously I needed some help and that came in the form of Kate from Veggie Desserts.\n\nIf anyone refers to a cake as The Best Vegan Chocolate Cake, you know it has to be great.\n\nSo I took this as my base recipe and gave it a few tweaks to make it into my version which is Vegan Chocolate Orange Loaf Cake.\n\n\nVegan food is increasing in popularity \nOver the last few years, veganism has become a lot more popular. Whether you are vegan, dairy free or just trying to eat less dairy; vegan cakes are great to have in your repertoire.\n\nIt is always nice to have a collection of recipes you can go to so that everyone’s dietary requirements are catered for.\n\nIt makes people feel more loved and included if you can cater for them which is always lovely.\n\nAnother variation that you might like are Gluten Free & Vegan Chocolate Orange Cupcakes. \n\nWhich dairy free alternatives are best to use?\nThere are quite a few different dairy free margarines available to buy. They are usually very clearly marked as vegan so you don’t have to worry about checking the ingredients.\n\nI tend to use Vitalite, but there are lots of other brands that will work just as well.\n\nFor the milk, you could use soy, almond or oat milk. I would avoid using anything like coconut or hazelnut milk that has a distinct flavour as this may mask or not work with the orange.\n\nYou can use sweetened or unsweetened dairy free milk for these recipes, whichever you prefer.\n\n\nDo vegan cakes taste different?\nNot at all. If you weren’t told this cake was vegan, I strongly believe you wouldn’t be able to tell.\n\nNumerous people have tasted this cake and other vegan cakes I have baked and they wouldn’t have guessed. When they find out they are surprised at how light and fluffy they are. \n\nThe beauty of a loaf cake\nI love loaf cakes because of how simple and delicious they are.\n\nAll you need to do it mix the ingredients together and pour them into the tin and then you’re done! You don’t need to divide the batter between tins, no additional decorating is required. Just simple.\n\nIf you do want to make it a bit more fancy you can do though.\n\n\nCan you add buttercream to this cake?\nYes you definitely could. I think dairy-free margarine makes absolutely delicious buttercream.\n\nIf you wanted to add buttercream, I would use half the amount that is in my Gluten Free & Vegan Chocolate Orange Cupcakes recipe.\n\nYou could then decorate it with orange peel or anything else you’d like.\n\nIf you didn’t want to use buttercream but wanted to decorate it, you could drizzle melted dark chocolate over the top.\n\n\nVegan Chocolate Orange Loaf Cake baking tips \nOne of my least favourite baking tasks is sifting ingredients. Because of this, I do try to avoid sieving as much as possible but please do make sure you sieve the flour and cocoa powder for this cake.\n\nIf you don’t you do run the risk of little lumps of flour finding their way into your finished cake. While this isn’t a disaster, it doesn’t look the best in the finished cake. So bite the bullet and get your sieve out! \n\nDon’t get alarmed by adding coffee to the cake! Coffee is a great way of enhancing the chocolate flavour in baking. You won’t taste it in the finished cake but it will have worked its magic. \n\nHow long will this cake keep for?\nThis cake will keep for 2-3 days in an airtight container.\n\nYou could wrap this cake thoroughly and freeze it for up to three months.\n\n\nOther recipes you might enjoy\nOreo Cupcakes (Vegan)\nVegan Vanilla & Raspberry Jam Cupcakes\nVegan Chocolate Hazelnut Cupcakes\nGluten Free & Vegan Chocolate Orange Cupcakes\nVegan Vanilla & Raspberry Jam Cupcakes\nPin for later\n\n\n4.84 from 18 votes\n Print\nVegan Chocolate Orange Loaf Cake\nSuper light, fluffy and deliciously moist, no one will believe you that this Vegan Chocolate Orange Loaf Cake is actually vegan!\n\n\n Course Cake\n Cuisine British\n Keyword Chocolate Orange, Vegan, Dairy Free\n Prep Time 15 minutes\n Cook Time 50 minutes\n Servings 14\n Calories 207 kcal\n Author Adapted from Veggie Desserts\nIngredients\n280 ml soy milk or any non-dairy milk such as almond\n1 orange zested\n4 tbsp orange juice\n150 g dairy free margarine\n3 tbsp golden syrup\n1 tsp instant coffee granules\n275 g self raising flour\n175 g caster sugar\n4 tbsp cocoa powder\n1 tsp bicarbonate of soda\nInstructions\nPreheat the oven to 160ºC (fan assisted, 180ºC non fan) and line a 2lb loaf tin\n\nZest the orange before juicing it.

However, observed-to-expected mortality ratios were highest in the population aged 25 to 64 years, particularly among American Indian or Alaska Native, Hispanic, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander groups; among people aged at least 25 years, the Black population accounted for 51.1% of excess mortality; disparities deviated from prepandemic baselines.\n\nMeaning  These results suggest that the COVID-19 PHE disproportionately affected several minoritized racial and ethnic groups; the largest relative increases occurred in the population aged 25 to 64 years, implying lasting downstream consequences.\n\nAbstract\nImportance  The end of the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE) provides an opportunity to fully describe pandemic-associated racial and ethnic mortality disparities. Age-specific excess mortality differences have important downstream implications, especially in minoritized race and ethnicity populations.\n\nObjectives  To characterize overall and age-specific all-cause excess mortality by race and ethnicity during the COVID-19 PHE and assess whether measured differences reflected changes from prepandemic disparities.\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants  This cross-sectional study analyzed data of all US residents and decedents during the COVID-19 PHE, aggregated by observed race and ethnicity (at time of death) and age. Statistical analysis was performed from March 2020 to May 2023.\n\nExposures  COVID-19 PHE period (March 2020 to May 2023).\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures  All-cause excess mortality (incident rates, observed-to-expected ratios) and all-cause mortality relative risks before and during the PHE.\n\nResults  For the COVID-19 PHE period, data for 10 643 433 death certificates were available; mean (SD) decedent age was 72.7 (17.9) years; 944 318 (8.9%) were Hispanic; 78 973 (0.7%) were non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native; 288 680 (2.7%) were non-Hispanic Asian, 1 374 228 (12.9%) were non-Hispanic Black or African American, 52 905 (0.5%) were non-Hispanic more than 1 race, 15 135 (0.1%) were non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and 7 877 996 (74.1%) were non-Hispanic White. More than 1.38 million all-cause excess deaths (observed-to-expected ratio, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.12-1.18]) occurred, corresponding to approximately 23 million years of potential life lost (YPLL) during the pandemic. For the total population (all ages), the racial and ethnic groups with the highest observed-to-expected all-cause mortality ratios were the American Indian or Alaska Native (1.34 [95% CI, 1.31-1.37]) and Hispanic (1.31 [95% CI, 1.27-1.34]) populations. However, higher ratios were observed in the US population aged 25 to 64 years (1.20 [95% CI, 1.18-1.22]), greatest among the American Indian or Alaska Native (1.45 [95% CI, 1.42-1.48]), Hispanic (1.40 [95% CI, 1.38-1.42]), and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (1.39 [95% CI, 1.34-1.44]) groups. In the total population aged younger than 25 years, the Black population accounted for 51.1% of excess mortality, despite representing 13.8% of the population. Had the rate of excess mortality observed among the White population been observed among the total population, more than 252 000 (18.3%) fewer excess deaths and more than 5.2 million (22.3%) fewer YPLL would have occurred.\n\nConclusions and Relevance  In this cross-sectional study of the US population during the COVID-19 PHE, excess mortality occurred in all racial and ethnic groups, with disparities affecting several minoritized populations. The greatest relative increases occurred in populations aged 25 to 64 years. Documented differences deviated from prepandemic disparities."

WORM.\nWhat do you see: A list of animals? Or a list of insults?\nWell, it’s both. These animals’ names are insults when applied to humans.\nNow take this list: Lion. Eagle. Tiger. Again, a list of animals, but in this case they’re not insults at all.\nWhat’s the difference? Lions and eagles are predators—cool and efficient killing machines that stalk, slay, and then eat their victims. And yet for reasons that are not immediately apparent, humankind views this behavior as admirable. But whom did a vulture or a cockroach ever hurt? No one. It is because vultures, cockroaches, rats, worms, and thousands of other species are scavengers that they’re reviled. Hated, even. Scavengers don’t kill to eat. They eat what’s already dead. They eat no-longer-living matter that has been discarded or ignored by the rest of the animal kingdom. They eat what other animals don’t want. Yet despite being completely harmless to their fellow living creatures, scavengers are the most loathed species in the animal kingdom. Anthropomorphized, they epitomize the most despicable traits.\""

      "Extract the number of times the word \"Olympics\" is written in the following text:\n\nThe 2020 Summer Olympics,[c] officially the Games of the XXXII Olympiad[d] and officially branded as Tokyo 2020,[e] were an international multi-sport event held from 23 July to 8 August 2021 in Tokyo, Japan, with some preliminary events that began on 21 July 2021. Tokyo was selected as the host city during the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina on 7 September 2013.[3]\n\nOriginally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the event was postponed to 2021 on 24 March 2020 due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the first such instance in the history of the Olympic Games (several previous games had been cancelled but not rescheduled).[4][5] However, the event retained the Tokyo 2020 branding for marketing purposes.[6] It was largely held behind closed doors with no public spectators permitted due to the declaration of a state of emergency in the Greater Tokyo Area in response to the pandemic, the only Olympic Games to be held without official spectators.[f] The Games were the most expensive ever, with total spending of over $20 billion.[8]\n\nThe Games were the fourth Olympic Games to be held in Japan, following the 1964 Summer Olympics (Tokyo), 1972 Winter Olympics (Sapporo), and 1998 Winter Olympics (Nagano). Tokyo became the first city in Asia to hold the Summer Olympic Games twice.[g] The 2020 Games were the second of three consecutive Olympics to be held in East Asia, following the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea and preceding the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China. Due to the one-year postponement, it is the only Olympic Games to have been held in an odd-numbered year.[10]\n\nNew events were introduced in existing sports, including 3x3 basketball, freestyle BMX and mixed gender team events in a number of existing sports, as well as the return of madison cycling for men and an introduction of the same event for women. New IOC policies also allowed the host organizing committee to add new sports to the Olympic program for just one Games. The disciplines added by the Japanese Olympic Committee were baseball and softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing and skateboarding, the last four of which made their Olympic debuts, and the last three of which will remain on the Olympic program.[11]\n\nThe United States topped the medal table both by gold (39) and total medals (113), with China finishing second (38 and 89). Host nation Japan finished third, setting a record for the most gold and overall medals won by their delegation at an Olympic Games with 27 and 58. Great Britain finished fourth, with a total of 22 gold and 64 total medals. The Russian delegation competing as the ROC finished fifth with 20 gold medals and third in the overall medal count, with 71 medals. Bermuda, the Philippines and Qatar won their first-ever Olympic gold medals.[12][13][14] Burkina Faso, San Marino and Turkmenistan also won their first-ever Olympic medals.[15][16][17]"

      "I need to determine how many people have been fired from their positions in the federal government by the department of governmental efficiency. Using the text below, create a list that contains the numbers of people fired from each federal agency. I'd like you to report the list using bullet points, and organize it alphabetically by department. Then, provide the total at the end:\n\nA comprehensive look at DOGE’s firings and layoffs so far\nPresident Donald Trump listens as Elon Musk speaks in the Oval Office at the White House, Tuesday, Feb. 11, 2025, in Washington. (Photo/Alex Brandon)\nPresident Donald Trump listens as Elon Musk speaks in the Oval Office at the White House, Tuesday, Feb. 11, 2025, in Washington. (Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\n\nBy  MEG KINNARD\nUpdated 7:08 PM EST, February 21, 2025\nShare\n▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his new administration.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Thousands of federal government employees have been shown the door in the first month of President Donald Trump’s administration as the White House and its Department of Government Efficiency fire both new and career workers, tell agency leaders to plan for “large-scale reductions in force” and freeze trillions of dollars in federal grant funds.\n\nIt is affecting more than just the national capital region, home to about 20% of the 2.4 million members of the civilian federal workforce, which does not include military personnel and postal workers. More than 80% of that workforce lives outside the Washington area.\n\nThere is no official figure available for the total firings or layoffs. The Associated Press tallied how agencies are being affected based on AP reporting and statements from lawmakers and employee unions.\n\nHere is a look at some of the broad and specific ways federal agencies and employees are being affected by the administration’s reductions, as of Friday:\n\nRelated Stories\nTrump administration lays off probationary government workers, warns others of large cuts to come\nTrump administration lays off probationary government workers, warns others of large cuts to come\nTrump administration fires 1,000 workers at NPS\nTrump administration fires 1,000 workers at NPS\nPresident Trump offers buyout to all federal workers with 8 months' pay\nPresident Trump offers buyout to all federal workers with 8 months' pay\n‘Deferred resignation’ proposal for federal workers\nThe White House offered a “deferred resignation” proposal in exchange for financial incentives, like months of paid leave, to almost all federal employees who opted to leave their jobs by Feb. 6.\n\nBut just before that deadline, a federal judge blocked Trump’s plan, wanting to hear arguments from the administration and the labor unions, which said the offer was illegal.\n\nAccording to the Office of Personnel Management, about 75,000 federal employees had accepted the offer as of Feb. 12.\n\n\nProbationary employee layoffs\nThere have also been wide-ranging layoffs of probationary employees — those generally on the job for less than a year and who have yet to gain civil service protection. Potentially hundreds of thousands are affected.\n\nOn Feb. 13, the administration ordered agencies to lay off nearly all such workers. According to government data maintained by OPM, 220,000 federal employees had less than a year on the job as of March 2024.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs\nOn Feb. 13, the Department of Veterans Affairs announced the dismissal of more than 1,000 employees who had served for less than two years. According to Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., that included researchers working on cancer treatment, opioid addiction, prosthetics and burn pit exposure.\n\nDefense Department\nThe Defense Department said Friday that it’s cutting 5,400 probationary workers starting next week and will put a hiring freeze in place. Uniformed military personnel are exempt.\n\nPentagon officials anticipate reducing the civilian workforce by 5% to 8%, Darin Selnick, who is acting undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, said in a statement.\n\nThe Defense Department is the largest government agency, with the Government Accountability Office finding in 2023 that it had more than 700,000 full-time civilian workers.\n\nEducation Department\nAt least 39 people have been fired from the Education Department, including special education specialists and student aid officials, according to a union that represents agency workers.\n\nThere have also been nearly $900 million in cuts to the department’s Institute of Education Services, which tracks the progress of America’s students. It is unclear to what degree the institute would continue to exist. Industry experts said at least 169 contracts were terminated on Feb. 10.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnergy Department\nHundreds of federal employees tasked with working on the nation’s nuclear weapons programs were laid off on Feb. 13, but that move was largely rescinded hours later, according to a memo obtained by the AP. Three U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation said as many as 350 employees at the National Nuclear Security Administration were ousted, with some losing access to email before they had learned they were fired.\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services\nThe jobs of more than 5,000 probationary employees are on the line at the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nOn Feb. 14, officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were told they were losing nearly 1,300 probationary employees — about one-tenth of the agency’s workforce — but the final number was closer to 700, according to two CDC officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the cuts.\n\nProbationary employees were also fired at public health agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, but HHS has not released a final number.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security\nAt the Department of Homeland Security, 405 people who were identified as probationary staffers were let go, the agency said.\n\nAbout half of those cuts — more than 200 — came from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Those cuts were separate from the firings of the agency’s chief financial officer, two program analysts and a grant specialist, who were terminated Feb. 11 over payments to reimburse New York City for hotel costs for migrants.\n\nA little over 130 were let go at the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, which oversees the nation’s critical infrastructure, including the federal efforts to secure election systems.\n\nA little less than 50 were let go from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services which processes immigration-related benefits while 10 staff were let go from the agency’s Science & Technology directorate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInternal Revenue Service\nThe IRS will lay off thousands of probationary workers in the middle of tax season, according to two people familiar with the agency’s plans who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nIt is unclear how many IRS workers will be affected or when the cuts will happen.\n\nNational Park Service\nThe administration has fired about 1,000 newly hired National Park Service employees who maintain and clean parks, educate visitors and perform other functions.\n\nThe firings were not publicly announced but were confirmed by Democratic senators and House members. Adding to the confusion, the park service now says it is reinstating about 5,000 seasonal jobs that were initially rescinded last month.\n\nSeasonal workers are routinely added during the warm-weather months to serve more than 325 million annual visitors who descend on the nation’s 428 parks, historic sites and other attractions.\n\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau\nThe administration has ordered the agency — created after the 2008 financial crisis and subprime mortgage-lending scandal — to stop nearly all its work, effectively shutting it down.\n\nAgriculture Department\nThe new agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, said on Feb. 14 that her agency had invited Elon Musk’s DOGE team with “open arms” and that layoffs “will be forthcoming.”\n\nA spokesman for the department, which oversees the Forest Service, said Rollins supports Trump’s directive to eliminate inefficiencies by firing about 2,000 “probationary, non-firefighting employees.”\n\nRollins is committed to “preserving essential safety positions and will ensure that critical services remain uninterrupted,” the spokesman said in a statement, which did not address the fired workers who were responsible for thinning trees, removing combustible debris from forests and other projects that aim to lower a wildfire’s intensity.\n\nOn Feb. 19, the department scrambled to rehire several workers who were involved in the government’s response to the ongoing bird flu outbreak that has devastated egg and poultry farms over the past three years, but who were among the thousands of federal employees eliminated on Musk’s recommendations.\n\nIt wasn’t immediately clear how many workers the department might be trying to rehire and whether any of them worked at the main USDA lab in Ames, Iowa.\n\nForeign aid and development\nTrump swiftly ordered a halt to much of the aid that the United States sends abroad. Several weeks later, the pause is on pause.\n\nIn his first week in office, Trump issued an executive order directing a 90-day hold on most of the foreign assistance disbursed through the State Department.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio issued several specific exemptions, including emergency food programs and military aid to Israel and Egypt from the freeze on foreign assistance. But thousands of U.S.-funded humanitarian, development and security programs worldwide stopped work or prepared to do so.\n\nWithout the money to pay staff, aid organizations including the U.S. Agency for International Development began laying off hundreds of employees. Crews removed the agency’s signage from its Washington headquarters.\n\nBut on Feb. 13, a federal judge considering some of the lawsuits challenging agency cuts ordered the administration to temporarily lift the funding freeze.\n\nFederal grants and loans\nThe White House said last month it was pausing federal grants and loans as the Republican administration began an across-the-board ideological review.\n\nThe freeze could affect trillions of dollars and cause widespread disruption in health care research, education programs and other initiatives. Even grants that have been awarded but not spent are supposed to be halted.\n\n“The use of Federal resources to advance Marxist equity, transgenderism, and green new deal social engineering policies is a waste of taxpayer dollars that does not improve the day-to-day lives of those we serve,” said a memo from Matthew Vaeth, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nDemocrats and independent organizations said the move was illegal because Congress had already authorized the funding.\n\nInspectors general\nEach of the federal government’s largest agencies has its own independent inspector general who is supposed to conduct objective audits, prevent fraud and promote efficiency.\n\nTrump has fired at least 17 of them, including watchdogs he appointed in his first term. At least one Democratic appointee, Michael Horowitz at the Justice Department, was spared.\n\nTrump told reporters that “it’s a very common thing to do” and that he would “put good people in there that will be very good.”\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the firings were a “chilling purge.” Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a top Trump ally, acknowledged that the firings may have violated the law, but he added, “Just tell them you need to follow the law next time.”\n\nDepartment of Justice\nIt’s normal for politically appointed U.S. attorneys to be replaced, but it is not standard procedure for career prosecutors to be ousted with a change in administration.\n\nThe Justice Department said last month that it had fired more than a dozen employees who worked on criminal prosecutions of Trump by special counsel Jack Smith’s team.\n\nBy tradition, career employees remain with the department across presidential administrations regardless of their involvement in sensitive investigations.\n\nMultiple senior career officials were also reassigned.\n\nState Department\nA large number of senior career diplomats who served in politically appointed leadership positions — as well as in lower-level posts at the State Department — left their jobs at the demand of the new administration.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how many nonpolitical appointees were being asked to leave.\n"

      "Extract all the dog breeds specifically named in this text. Place them in a bulleted list and in alphabetical order:\n\nI took a course in ethology (Ethology is the scientific and objective study of non-human animal behavior rather than human behavior and usually with a focus on behavior under natural conditions, and viewing behavior as an evolutionarily adaptive trait) at Purdue University years ago. The professor spoke one day about how some animals are considered stupid, such as sheep. First off, people tend to anthropomorphize animals and expect them to think and learn things the same way people do. Second, the intelligence of one species or breed shouldn't be compared to that of another, because each species has the intelligence that it needs to survive. Domestic animals, such as sheep and dogs, have been bred by humans to have specific purposes. Sheep are herd animals as there is protection for the individual by being part of a herd. They are naturally a prey animal, so running from a predator is their defense mechanism. They eat vegetation, so they graze. They don't really need to know how to do much else. Most or all of the purebred dog breeds were created by humans for specific purposes. Herding breeds, such as border collies and heelers, and sporting dogs, such as Golden Retrievers and Labrador retrievers, were bred with specific purposes that involved working closely with humans and listening to commands. They're usually perceived by people as being more intelligent than other dogs because they're more willing to listen to humans and learn commands, but that is what they were bred for! If you go to obedience or agility trials, you will generally see these breeds there - people who want to be more competitive in these sports will usually pick these breeds to show. The hound breeds, such as beagles, dachshunds, and basset hounds, and some of the working dog breeds, such as Dobermans, were bred to work independently, as opposed to relying on or working continuously with humans for instructions. They should NOT be expected to respond the same way to training as the herding and sporting dogs, because that is NOT what they were bred for. When tracking an animal or a human, the hound dog is in the lead, not its owner. The hound dog needs to know how to find the prey or lost person without being shown by its owner or being given constant commands. Of course, there is some initial training involved, but then the dogs are able to work on their own. For example, in dachshund field trials, a rabbit is flushed from cover by humans and the judges watch to see where the rabbit goes. Two dachshunds are brought up to where the rabbit was first spotted, the dachshunds are put on the scent line and then released to track the rabbit on their own. The owners can no longer say anything to their dogs once the dogs are released, and the owners have to stay behind the judges. The dogs are working purely on their own. While beagle and basset hound trials are run a little differently, the concept is the same. They are all judged on how they work on their own. It's the same thing in earthdog tests - the dogs work independently of their owners. Go watch a herding dog trial or retriever trials, and you'll see the dogs being tested on how well they respond to their owner's commands to do their jobs! While different breeds can be trained to perform the same tasks, such as in obedience, agility, and barn hunt, training has to be catered to some extent to the particular breed. If you understand the personality characteristics of your breed, then you can get much better results from training. A miniature dachshund may not respond very well to commands given in the same manner as you could give them to a border collie. The dachshund is perceived as being stubborn or willful for not responding as quickly or easily as a border collie, but the dachshund was bred to think on its own, and it doesn't have the same incentive or sense of reward for responding to commands as the border collie. The dachshund wants to hunt, not do obedience or agility! Dogs are also very much in the moment. Dogs don't rationalize the way humans do, and they don't make comparisons between two separate incidents. For example, a dog isn't going to understand that being dropped into a bush means you want it to stay off of a particular chair! The dog finds the chair comfortable or a good perch so it can see out into the yard. The dog doesn't understand his owner doesn't want him to sit on the chair. All he knows is that his owner randomly drops him into a bush! The dog should be shown a different place to sit and taught to sit there by being rewarded for sitting there. Dropping him into a bush only shows him that his owner is randomly cruel. When you take breeds that were bred for hunting, and you put them into situations that never allow them to perform that activity, such as living indoors, they generally still have those hunting instincts and behaviors, but they end up getting expressed in different ways. The basset may spend most of its time hunting for food since it has no other outlet for its hunting drive. It benefits both the dog and its owner if the owner studies up on the breed before acquiring that breed. That way you can find a breed that suits your personality, and both of you will be happier."

      "\"Henry VIII was King of England from 22 April 1509 until his death in 1547. Henry is known for his six marriages and his efforts to have his first marriage (to Catherine of Aragon) annulled. He founded the Royal Navy, oversaw the annexation of Wales to England with the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542, and was the first English monarch to rule as King of Ireland following the Crown of Ireland Act 1542. Born on 28 June 1491 at the Palace of Placentia in Greenwich, Kent, Henry Tudor was the third child and second son of King Henry VII and Elizabeth of York. In May 1495, he was appointed to the Order of the Garter. \nIn November 1501, Henry played a considerable part in the ceremonies surrounding his brother Arthur's marriage to Catherine, the youngest child of King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile.[12] As duke of York, Henry used the arms of his father as king, differenced by a label of three points ermine. He was further honoured on 9 February 1506 by Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, who made him a Knight of the Golden Fleece. \nIn 1502, Arthur died at the age of 15, just 20 weeks after his marriage to Catherine of Aragon.[14] Arthur's death thrust all his duties upon his younger brother. The 10-year-old Henry became the new Duke of Cornwall, and the new Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester in February 1504. \nHenry VII died in April 1509, and the 17-year-old Henry succeeded him as king.[21] Soon after his father's burial on 10 May, Henry suddenly declared that he would indeed marry Catherine, leaving unresolved several issues concerning the papal dispensation and a missing part of the marriage portion.[18][22] The new king maintained that it had been his father's dying wish that he marry Catherine.[20] Whether or not this was true, it was convenient. Emperor Maximilian I had been attempting to marry his granddaughter Eleanor, Catherine's niece, to Henry; she had now been jilted.[23] Henry's wedding to Catherine was modest and was held at the friars' church in Greenwich on 11 June 1509.[22] Henry claimed descent from Constantine the Great and King Arthur and saw himself as their successor.\"\n\nPlease extract all years from this text (not full dates).

      "Please extract the following things from the article and write them in a numbered list with a bolded header for each category: 1. The title of the article, 2. The date the article was written, 3. the list of benefits of arts education, 4. the list of creative habits that students gain from arts education. \n \nThe Importance of Art Education in the Classroom\n November 30, 2023\n\nFacebook  Twitter  Linkedin  Email\nPaintbrushes in plastic cups of paint in an Art Education classroomIn October 2019, the British street artist known as Banksy opened an online store called Gross Domestic Product and issued a challenge: to make a purchase from the shop’s selection of items like a Banksy-branded aerosol paint can, a brick handbag, and a vest worn in concert by the rapper Stormzy. Customers who wished to be considered for the opportunity to make a single purchase first had to answer the question: “Why does art matter?”\n\nThat deceptively simple, four-word query confronts a topic that’s occupied some of the world’s greatest creators and philosophers since Plato. How we answer this question can have much bigger consequences than whether you get to buy a piece of artwork from Banksy’s online store. The issue of art’s value becomes far more pressing when policymakers and administrators decide how to allocate time and funding for art education in schools.\n\nArt teachers must be ready to advocate for committing the necessary resources to prioritize the value of creativity in the classroom. You may have to explain the importance of art education in a school’s curriculum and present the research to back up those claims. We can become powerful advocates for the power of art and improved student outcomes by investigating the many benefits that come out of integrating more creativity into the school day and improving our classroom strategies.\n\nWhy Is Art Education In Schools Important?\nAnyone who’s passionate about the arts recalls formative moments of experiencing a work of art pushing through a creative challenge. When we’re exposed to remarkable artworks or have opportunities to create, we find that art is crucial to individual growth and development and can even impact our health.\n\nA literature review from Frontiers in Psychology outlined several studies linking aesthetic experiences with broad improvements in subjects’ emotional states that promote physical and psychological well-being. Giving learners the time, space, and materials for creative expression can lower stress, improve memory, and make them feel more socially connected. Instructors can build their careers on bringing those experiences to students in a variety of settings, like galleries, museums, or events organized by nonprofit and community organizations.\n\nAppreciation for art also makes a significant difference in people’s lives on a macro level. Entire societies may stand to gain from an investment in the arts. Drawing on data from the General Social Survey, researchers from the University of Illinois at Chicago’s Department of Public Administration linked participation as either an audience member or creator to higher levels of civic engagement and social tolerance. This work suggests that children learning how to draw, paint, sing, or just appreciate the works made by others can help us become not just happier and healthier, but also better people.\n\nLearn about UF’s Online Master of Arts in Art Education program\nHow Does Art Education Help Students?\nWhen surveyed by the nonprofit organization Americans for the Arts, members of the U.S. public overwhelmingly agreed that the arts are one aspect of a well-rounded K-12 education. In addition, a recent study conducted in Houston public schools showed that students who participated in arts education see the following benefits:\n\nImproved writing achievement\nReduced disciplinary infractions\nMore student engagement\nImproved college aspirations\nNo drop in standardized test scores\nYet, participation in the visual and performing arts is often treated as merely supplemental to other aspects of learning. As a result, there are major differences in access to art and music classes across the country.\n\n2019 findings from the National Assessment of Educational Progress showed that eighth graders in the Northeast were much more likely to report being enrolled in a visual arts course than those in the South. Disparities were also tied to race, ethnicity, family income, and whether a school is located in a city, suburb, town, or rural area.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nation’s Report Card shows that U.S. students continue to score lower than many of their peers in Europe and Asia on standardized tests despite years of pressure on educators to close the achievement gap. But seeking to improve student performance in math and reading does not have to come at the expense of art education.\n\nIn fact, researchers from the Johns Hopkins University School of Education, argue that instruction becomes more effective when educators integrate creative activities and make them central to academic development. Across disciplines, including STEM, there’s room to reimagine classes with a strong emphasis on drawing, painting, playing music, performing drama, and other creative pursuits. Encouraging students to use their imagination can help them actively engage with new concepts and discover connections between ideas as well as provide advantages for their social and emotional well-being.\n\nOne example of effectively integrating arts and creative expression with other fields as a pedagogical strategy can be seen in the collaboration between University of Florida faculty members Susan K. Jacobson, who studies wildlife ecology and conservation, and Robert C. Mueller, who teaches printmaking. The UF professors collaborated on an interdisciplinary project in climate change communication in which groups of graduate students from both the School of Natural Resources and the Environment and the College of the Arts visited the university’s Seahorse Key Marine Laboratory. The students participated in learning activities like scientific lectures, discussions, and making collages before working in small groups to create environmental communication materials for visitors.\n\nAs this example shows, students benefit from learning to embrace insights from multiple disciplines, and this can be valuable when they go on to pursue jobs. A 2019 survey from the National Association of Colleges and Employers showed that employers are interested in hiring professionals with skills that can be strengthened through participation in the arts, such as written communication, problem-solving, teamwork, and taking initiative. Art teachers can help students become more well-rounded and capable individuals by teaching them to develop original ideas through creative projects and practices.\n\nThe Importance of Art Education in Early Childhood and Beyond\nIt’s never too soon to introduce kids to the possibilities of creative expression. As outlined in a literature review from the National Endowment for the Arts, a variety of studies demonstrate the value of embedding artistic practice into early childhood education. Imaginative activities for young learners can lead to better skills in social interactions and emotional regulation.\n\nLessons in the arts introduce K-12 students to problem-solving techniques, which help them to see the world in new ways, and provide access to creative ways of knowing. Kids discover how art can communicate their own ideas and may become interested in creating increasingly realistic depictions and mastering new techniques. By high school, young artists can think critically about their own work and that of others, establishing a unique point of view and a sense of community with other creative individuals.\n\nThe National Core Arts Standards provide a framework for advancing students’ artistic understanding. This structure breaks down the developmental stages from Pre K through high school into 10 anchor standards. In each stage, students build creative habits as they learn to:\n\nGenerate and conceptualize artistic ideas and work\nOrganize and develop ideas and work\nRefine and complete artistic work\nSelect, analyze, and interpret artistic work for presentation\nConvey meaning through the presentation\nPerceive and analyze artistic work\nInterpret intent and meaning\nApply criteria to evaluate work\nMake art by synthesizing and relating knowledge and personal experiences\nDeepen understanding by relating artistic ideas to societal, historical, and cultural contexts\nPediatrician Dr. Perri Klass outlined the benefits of art education in schools in the New York Times, noting improvements for overall motivation, thinking, and academic achievement. An arts-integrated curriculum that asks students to draw or sing as part of the learning process may enhance their ability to recall material such as scientific principles or vocabulary. Foregrounding creativity can be especially effective for students who struggle to retain information from traditional lectures and reading assignments alone.\n\nArt does matter in the classroom, delivering a wide range of advantages for students. Educators can make the most of that potential by equipping themselves to offer creative practice as a central feature in the curriculum and show decisionmakers how these initiatives can achieve transformative results. The University of Florida’s online Master of Arts in Art Education (MAAE) program helps teachers make a difference. This program features courses that prepare educators to work in a variety of learning environments, support students of all ages, incorporate digital tools into their pedagogy, and foster critical thinking."

Pluralism is “the engagement that creates a common society from all that diversity” (The Pluralism Project, 2020) It is more than tolerating other faiths; it is working together with them to create a safe, productive community for everybody.\nReligious Diversity\nThe United States is the home to a wide range of religions. This is the result of people from different nations immigrating to the States. Different faiths and religious practices are prominent in other countries, and immigrants carry these beliefs with them. They established places of worship and other community features to meet their religious needs. Immigration is what has allowed the United States to house such a diverse range of spiritual beliefs. \nThis diversity of beliefs is why it is important to maintain a separation of church and state. If these two entities became intertwined, it is unlikely that all religions practiced in the United States would be considered. Instead, a singular religion would likely become dominant through its entanglement with the government, which could result in the oppression of religious practices. The state’s involvement with religious institutions should not evolve beyond the protections of peoples’ rights to practice their religions freely. By protecting everyone’s rights to their own spiritual beliefs, a pluralistic society where everyone is safe and acknowledged can be formed. \nThe religious landscape of the United States is constantly changing. In the last 25 years, these changes have been both positive and negative. When harmful events occur and the ones responsible have a religion tied to them, the public can believe that everyone of that religion endorses these actions. This results in harmful stereotypes and prejudices. For example, a negative perception of Islamic people became more prominent in the United States after the 9/11 attacks. An example of this was “when a Florida pastor made international news by threatening to burn a Qur’an to mark the 10th anniversary of 9/11, an action he carried out in 2011 and 2012” (The Pluralism Project, 2020).\nThe current religious landscape is not entirely made up of prejudice and harsh lines of division. Modern religious practices have also been trying t to engage with other religions, resulting in interfaith communities and charitable efforts. A “concurrent re-examination of the relation of Christianity to other religions that has been strong, positive, and biblically-based. The Roman Catholic Church and most of the major Protestant denominations have given new emphasis to interfaith dialogue as essential to the relation of Christians to people of other faiths” (The Pluralism Project, 2020). This is the backbone of a pluralistic society because it requires different faiths to engage, understand, and work together. \n\n"

Do not mention their context in this article. Number them in the order in which they appear. Use large words.\n\nRobert Steven Moore (born January 18, 1952) is an American multi-instrumentalist, singer, and songwriter who pioneered lo-fi (or \"DIY\") music. Often called the \"godfather of home recording\",[1] he is one of the most recognized artists of the cassette underground, and his influence is particularly felt in the bedroom and hypnagogic pop artists of the post-millennium. Since 1968, he has self-released approximately 400 albums,[2] while about three dozen official albums (largely compilations) have been issued on various labels.[3]\n\nBorn the son of Nashville A-Team bassist Bob Moore, Steven grew up in the 1960s listening to the Beatles, the Beach Boys, the Mothers of Invention, and Jimi Hendrix.[1] In his teens, he acquired access to a reel-to-reel stereo tape deck and began recording as a one-man band in his parents' home. The innovative manipulation of low fidelity recording processes in his early albums defined his general aesthetic. With help from his uncle, he made his official label debut with 1976's compilation Phonography, which was well received in New York's punk and new wave circles. Although he is best known for \"'60s-inspired power pop in the XTC vein,\"[4] his body of work incorporates a variety of music genres, both popular and experimental, and his records are typically styled after freeform radio. He describes his prolific output as \"a diary of sound\".[1][5]\n\nFrom 1978 until 2010, Moore lived and recorded in his apartment studios in northern New Jersey. He was also a WFMU staff member for a number of years. In 1982, he launched the R. Stevie Moore Cassette Club, his home-based mailing service. Throughout the 1980s, the French label New Rose released a series of Moore vinyl albums: Everything (1984), Glad Music (1986), Teenage Spectacular (1987), and Warning (1988). After the 2000s, he became better known for his associations with Ariel Pink, who frequently praised Moore as his \"mentor\".[1]"

Lots of times I saw it but I never went down in it. Once a couple of Scouts from camp told me there were rattlesnakes in it; I guess that was the reason. All the times I had been to it before I followed the brook from Black Lake. You can see how it goes on the map I made, not saying what kind of a map it is. I guess I’d get about six minus for it in school—I should worry. Anyway Beaver Chasm is a deep place that the brook flows through. That brook starts away off some place or other and goes west through the chasm, then south into Black Lake. It takes a west southerly course—gee, I remind myself of a geography lesson—that’s one study I have no use for.\n\nAnyway you needn’t bother about the brook now so you can let it flow merrily, merrily, what care we—that’s in my school reader. Do you see where the arrows are pointing? Where it says Roy’s route and Through the woods? Well that’s the way the four of us went and you can see where we got becalmed near the Bagley’s Green railroad station, only the map doesn’t show where the wind went and anyway I don’t know how to make a picture of the wind.\n\nAfter we started off with Mr. Bagley we went north up through the woods toward the chasm. I never went to it that way before. All the times I had gone to it I had gone in at the end of it like the brook does, I hope I make myself plain, that’s dandy language like a real author. You see where Bagley Center is? It’s about two miles north of the chasm. There are a lot of stores there and everything. It’s a flourishing met—something or other, only I don’t know how to spell it.\n\nI don’t like maps any better than you do and there are only two more things about this one. Do you see how there’s a road going from Bagley Center to Catskill? You can’t see Catskill but anyway it’s off in that direction and you can get dandy big ice cream cones there in Schnizel’s Confectionery. But if you’re hiking from Catskill to Bagley Center there’s a short cut through the woods and for quite a ways you don’t have to bother with the road. I made a dotted line for that trail and it goes across Beaver Chasm on three or four logs side by side—some bridge! So now you know all about the country where we were going to have some adventures.\n\nSo now you have to answer questions. 1. Which way did Roy Blakeley and his four companions approach Beaver Chasm? Correct, be seated. 2. Which way can you take a short cut through the woods from Catskill to Bagley Center? Point out where the log bridge is? Then you can go home if you want to, I don’t care.\n\nWhen we got to the chasm we were on the south side of it, and I can tell you one thing, that chasm is good and deep. The sides are pretty steep too—all rocks. When I looked down into it I saw that there wasn’t any brook at all, it was dried up Then I remembered how every one at camp was saying that the lake was very low that season. Uncle Jeb (he’s manager) said it was lower than he had ever seen it before. That was the first thing Pee-wee said to me; he said, “Oh, look how the brook isn’t there!”\n\nI said, “Yes, I can see the brook, it isn’t there. No, we have plenty of bananas.”\n\nWe were standing right on the edge near the logs that go across. Dub and Sandy were seeing the chasm for the first time. They both said they never thought it was anything like that—so deep. I guess they were surprised.\n\nDub said, “Jumping jiminies, why didn’t you ever tell us about this place?” That’s the way it is with new fellows at Temple Camp.\n\nBut anyway the place even seemed different to me now on account of what I heard about it. Oh boy, did we listen! Mr. Bagley said that when they found his father in the chasm one of the logs was lying in the bottom of the chasm too; it was broken in halves. The old man must have been on his way back from Catskill and he was taking the short cut through the woods. While he was crossing on the logs one of them broke and he fell and was killed. Mr. Bagley pointed down to the very spot where they found his father. Then he pointed down to a lot of bushes and he said that was where they found his father’s coat. For a couple of minutes we all stood there just staring down into the chasm. Even Pee-wee didn’t say anything. When you know something happened in a place—like getting killed—that place seems kind of scary. And besides I had never looked down into it like that before. When you go in where the brook is, it doesn’t seem so deep and dark.\n\nOne of us asked Mr. Bagley if he had any idea how his father’s coat happened to be away from his body, because that seemed funny.\n\nHe said, “I have no more idea than the man in the moon. All I know is that when we lifted his coat off that clump of brush the oilskin container was not in any of the pockets. We know that he went to Catskill. We know that he signed his will and had it witnessed. We know that he started back. We found him the next day lying against that big rock down there. On the night that he met his death his two cousins, Caleb and Bertha Clemm, were in their home. I live with them there now. He is an old bachelor and she is an old maid. But I don’t hold that against them—I’m an old bachelor too. But I’ve had a roving career. Now you boys who are so clever, what do you make out of that mystery?”\n\n“Jiminies,” I just gasped.\n\nSandy and Dub just shook their heads.\n\nPee-wee said, “Do you know what I bet? I bet that oilskin thing is down there, somewhere; I bet it’s there yet. And I bet we can find it.”\n\nMr. Bagley said, “My young friend, that is what I have thought for several years. I have searched this chasm many times. But I want you to notice one thing—the brook is dry. There are a hundred new places to search—dried up pools, crevices under rocks, places where I could only feel before, but which may now be seen. Well, I’ve brought you here and you are Boy Scouts. Here is an adventure for you.”\n\nLater on we attended a party with Chudd Jerkins. I guess you might say my memory gets a bit hazy here and the continuity of the story suffers a bit. But I distintly recall that Billy was at the party, and Susan White, and there was also Fred, and Bud, and a whole bunch of other folks whose names and even faces I can barely recall. Susan is probably the person I remember best from that time period.\n\n"

      "Please extract all cities/towns from this text, put them in a numbered list, and arrange them alphabetically. Then arrange them in a second list, using bullet points, with the cities in descending order of population in the year 1997.\n\nHolland is a geographical region[3] and former province on the western coast of the Netherlands.[3] From the 10th to the 16th century, Holland proper was a unified political region within the Holy Roman Empire as a county ruled by the counts of Holland. By the 17th century, the province of Holland had risen to become a maritime and economic power, dominating the other provinces of the newly independent Dutch Republic.\n\nThe area of the former County of Holland roughly coincides with the two current Dutch provinces of North Holland and South Holland into which it was divided, and which together include the Netherlands' three largest cities: the capital city (Amsterdam), the home of Europe's largest port (Rotterdam), and the seat of government (The Hague). Holland has a population of 6,583,534 as of November 2019,[1] and a population density of 1203/km2.\n\nThe name Holland has frequently been used informally to refer to the whole of the country of the Netherlands.[3] This casual usage is commonly accepted in other countries, and is even employed by many Dutch themselves.[4] However, some in the Netherlands (particularly those from regions outside Holland or the west) find it undesirable or misrepresentative to use the term for the whole country.[5] In January 2020, the Netherlands officially dropped its support of the word Holland for the whole country, which included a logo redesign that changed \"Holland\" to \"NL\".[6]\n\nEtymology and terminology\nThe name Holland first appeared in sources for the region around Haarlem, and by 1064 was being used as the name of the entire county. By the early twelfth century, the inhabitants of Holland were called Hollandi in a Latin text.[7] Holland is derived from the Old Dutch term holtlant ('wood-land').[8] This spelling variation remained in use until around the 14th century, at which time the name stabilised as Holland (alternative spellings at the time were Hollant and Hollandt). A popular but erroneous folk etymology holds that Holland is derived from hol land ('hollow land' in Dutch), purportedly inspired by the low-lying geography of the land.[8]\n\n\"Holland\" is informally used in English and other languages, including sometimes the Dutch language itself, to mean the whole of the modern country of the Netherlands.[5] This example of pars pro toto or synecdoche is similar to the tendency to refer to the United Kingdom as \"England\",[9][10] and developed due to Holland's becoming the dominant province and thus having the majority of political and economic interactions with other countries.[11]\n\nBetween 1806 and 1810 \"Holland\" was the official name for the country as a whole, after Napoleon made his brother Louis Bonaparte the monarch of the Kingdom of Holland.\n\nThe people of Holland are referred to as \"Hollanders\" in both Dutch and English, though in English this is now unusual. Today this refers specifically to people from the current provinces of North Holland and South Holland. Strictly speaking, the term \"Hollanders\" does not refer to people from the other provinces in the Netherlands, but colloquially \"Hollanders\" is sometimes used in this wider sense.\n\nIn Dutch, the word Hollands is the adjectival form for Holland. Hollands is also colloquially used by some Dutch people in the sense of Nederlands (the Dutch language), occasionally with the intention of contrasting with other types of Dutch people or forms of the language—for example Limburgish, the Belgian varieties of the Dutch language (\"Flemish\"), or even any southern variety of Dutch within the Netherlands itself.\n\nIn English, Dutch refers to the Netherlands as a whole, but there is no commonly used adjective for \"Holland\". The word \"Hollandish\" is no longer in common use. \"Hollandic\" is the name linguists give to the dialect spoken in Holland, and is occasionally also used by historians and when referring to pre-Napoleonic Holland.\n\nHistory\nInitially, Holland was a remote corner of the Holy Roman Empire. Gradually, its regional importance increased until it began to have a decisive, and ultimately dominant, influence on the History of the Netherlands.\n\nCounty of Holland\nFurther information: County of Holland\n\nHistorical coat of arms of the County of Holland\nUntil the start of the 12th century, the inhabitants of the area that became Holland were known as Frisians. The area was initially part of Frisia. At the end of the 9th century, West-Frisia became a separate county in the Holy Roman Empire. The first count known about with certainty was Dirk I, who ruled from 896 to 931. He was succeeded by a long line of counts in the House of Holland (who were in fact known as counts of Frisia until 1101). When John I died childless in 1299, the county was inherited by Count John II of Hainaut. By the time of William V (House of Wittelsbach; 1354–1388) the count of Holland was also the count of Hainaut and Zealand.\n\nAfter the St. Lucia's flood in 1287 the part of Frisia west of the later Zuiderzee, West Friesland, was conquered. As a result, most provincial institutions, including the States of Holland and West Frisia, would for more than five centuries refer to \"Holland and West Frisia\" as a unit. The Hook and Cod wars started around this time and ended when the countess of Holland, Jacoba or Jacqueline was forced to cede Holland to the Burgundian Philip III, known as Philip the Good, in 1432.\n\nIn 1432, Holland became part of the Burgundian Netherlands and since 1477 of the Habsburg Seventeen Provinces. In the 16th century the county became the most densely urbanised region in Europe, with the majority of the population living in cities. Within the Burgundian Netherlands, Holland was the dominant province in the north; the political influence of Holland largely determined the extent of Burgundian dominion in that area. The last count of Holland was Philip III, better known as Philip II, king of Spain. He was deposed in 1581 by the Act of Abjuration, although the kings of Spain continued to carry the titular appellation of Count of Holland until the Peace of Münster signed in 1648.\n\nDutch Republic\n\nA map of Holland from 1682\nIn the Dutch Rebellion against the Habsburgs during the Eighty Years' War, the naval forces of the rebels, the Watergeuzen, established their first permanent base in 1572 in the town of Brill. In this way, Holland, now a sovereign state in a larger Dutch confederation, became the centre of the rebellion. It became the cultural, political and economic centre of the United Provinces (Dutch: Verenigde Provinciën), in the 17th century, the Dutch Golden Age, the wealthiest nation in the world. After the King of Spain was deposed as the count of Holland, the executive and legislative power rested with the States of Holland, which was led by a political figure who held the office of Grand Pensionary.\n\nThe largest cities in the Dutch Republic were in the province of Holland, such as Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Leiden, Alkmaar, The Hague, Delft, Dordrecht and Haarlem. From the great ports of Holland, Hollandic merchants sailed to and from destinations all over Europe, and merchants from all over Europe gathered to trade in the warehouses of Amsterdam and other trading cities of Holland.\n\nMany Europeans thought of the United Provinces first as Holland rather than as the Republic of the Seven United Provinces of the Netherlands. A strong impression of Holland was planted in the minds of other Europeans, which then was projected back onto the Republic as a whole. Within the provinces themselves, a gradual slow process of cultural expansion took place, leading to a \"Hollandification\" of the other provinces and a more uniform culture for the whole of the Republic. The dialect of urban Holland became the standard language."

The film reunites Scorsese with his peerless acting muses Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci nearly 25 years after they made Casino. It also brings in a live-wire Al Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa, the Teamsters leader who De Niro’s hit man, Frank Sheeran, is ordered to kill. A digital de-aging process allows the actors to play younger as the film spans decades of American history. But it’s not violence that brings them down — it’s debilitating age. That searing note of poetic justice makes The Irishman unique among Scor­sese’s Mob films, from Goodfellas to The Departed, and earns a place in the cinematic canon.\""

      "Below, I will post the first chapter of Picture of Dorian Gray. I would like you to extract as many full names as you can from the text. If you could provide these in a bulleted list, and format the amount of times a name appears as follows: \"Phil Jackson - 3\" assuming \"Phil Jackson\" shows up three times. I would like the names to be sorted alphabetically by first name (treating anybody with only one given name as it being their first name for this purpose). Finally, I would like you to omit any names with a W anywhere in them.\n\n[Start of text]\nThe studio was filled with the rich odor of roses, and when the light summer wind stirred\namidst the trees of the garden there came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the\nmore delicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.\nFrom the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was lying, smoking, as usual,\ninnumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-\ncolored blossoms of the laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden\nof a beauty so flame-like as theirs; and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted\nacross the long tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window, producing a kind\nof momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of those pallid jade-faced painters who, in an art\nthat is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion. The sullen murmur of\nthe bees shouldering their way through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous insistence\nround the black-crocketed spires of the early June hollyhocks, seemed to make the stillness more\noppressive, and the dim roar of London was like the bourdon note of a distant organ.\nIn the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the full-length portrait of a young\nman of extraordinary personal beauty, and in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the\nartist himself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago caused, at the time, such\npublic excitement, and gave rise to so many strange conjectures.\nAs he looked at the gracious and comely form he had so skilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of\npleasure passed across his face, and seemed about to linger there. But he suddenly started up, and,\nclosing [4] his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he sought to imprison within his brain\nsome curious dream from which he feared he might awake.\n\"It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done,\" said Lord Henry, languidly. \"You\nmust certainly send it next year to the Grosvenor. The Academy is too large and too vulgar. The\nGrosvenor is the only place.\"\n\"I don't think I will send it anywhere,\" he answered, tossing his head back in that odd way that\nused to make his friends laugh at him at Oxford. \"No: I won't send it anywhere.\"\nLord Henry elevated his eyebrows, and looked at him in amazement through the thin blue wreaths\nof smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls from his heavy opium-tainted cigarette. \"Not send it\nanywhere? My dear fellow, why? Have you any reason? What odd chaps you painters are! You do\nanything in the world to gain a reputation. As soon as you have one, you seem to want to throw it\naway. It is silly of you, for there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that\nis not being talked about. A portrait like this would set you far above all the young men in England,\nand make the old men quite jealous, if old men are ever capable of any emotion.\"\n\"I know you will laugh at me,\" he replied, \"but I really can't exhibit it. I have put too much of\nmyself into it.\"\nLord Henry stretched his long legs out on the divan and shook with laughter.\n\"Yes, I knew you would laugh; but it is quite true, all the same.\"\n\"Too much of yourself in it! Upon my word, Basil, I didn't know you were so vain; and I really\ncan't see any resemblance between you, with your rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and\nthis young Adonis, who looks as if he was made of ivory and rose-leaves. Why, my dear Basil, he is a\nNarcissus, and you--well, of course you have an intellectual expression, and all that. But beauty, real\nbeauty, ends where an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself an exaggeration, and\ndestroys the harmony of any face. The moment one sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all\nforehead, or something horrid. Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions. How\nperfectly hideous they are! Except, of course, in the Church. But then in the Church they don't think. A\nbishop keeps on saying at the age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen, and\nconsequently he always looks absolutely delightful. Your mysterious young friend, whose name you\nhave never told me, but whose picture really fascinates me, never thinks. I feel quite sure of that. He is\na brainless, beautiful thing, who should be always here in winter when we have no flowers to look at,\nand always here in summer when we want something to chill our intelligence. Don't flatter yourself,\nBasil: you are not in the least like him.\"\n\"You don't understand me, Harry. Of course I am not like him. I know that perfectly well. Indeed,\nI should be sorry to look like him. You shrug your shoulders? I am telling you the truth. There is a\nfatality about all physical and intellectual distinction, the sort of fatality that [5] seems to dog through\nhistory the faltering steps of kings. It is better not to be different from one's fellows. The ugly and the\nstupid have the best of it in this world. They can sit quietly and gape at the play. If they know nothing\nof victory, they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat. They live as we all should live,\nundisturbed, indifferent, and without disquiet. They neither bring ruin upon others nor ever receive it\nfrom alien hands. Your rank and wealth, Harry; my brains, such as they are,--my fame, whatever it\nmay be worth; Dorian Gray's good looks,--we will all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer\nTerribly.\"\n\n\"Dorian Gray? is that his name?\" said Lord Henry, walking across the studio towards Basil\nHallward.\n\"Yes; that is his name. I didn't intend to tell it to you.\"\n\"But why not?\"\n\"Oh, I can't explain. When I like people immensely I never tell their names to any one. It seems\nlike surrendering a part of them. You know how I love secrecy. It is the only thing that can make\nmodern life wonderful or mysterious to us. The commonest thing is delightful if one only hides it.\nWhen I leave town I never tell my people where I am going. If I did, I would lose all my pleasure. It is\na silly habit, I dare say, but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into one's life. I\nsuppose you think me awfully foolish about it?\"\n\"Not at all,\" answered Lord Henry, laying his hand upon his shoulder; \"not at all, my dear Basil.\nYou seem to forget that I am married, and the one charm of marriage is that it makes a life of\ndeception necessary for both parties. I never know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what I\nam doing. When we meet,--we do meet occasionally, when we dine out together, or go down to the\nduke's,--we tell each other the most absurd stories with the most serious faces. My wife is very good\nat it,--much better, in fact, than I am. She never gets confused over her dates, and I always do. But\nwhen she does find me out, she makes no row at all. I sometimes wish she would; but she merely\nlaughs at me.\"\n\"I hate the way you talk about your married life, Harry,\" said Basil Hallward, shaking his hand off,\nand strolling towards the door that led into the garden. \"I believe that you are really a very good\nhusband, but that you are thoroughly ashamed of your own virtues. You are an extraordinary fellow.\nYou never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing. Your cynicism is simply a pose.\"\n\"Being natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose I know,\" cried Lord Henry, laughing;\nand the two young men went out into the garden together, and for a time they did not speak.\nAfter a long pause Lord Henry pulled out his watch. \"I am afraid I must be going, Basil,\" he\nmurmured, \"and before I go I insist on your answering a question I put to you some time ago.\"\n\"What is that?\" asked Basil Hallward, keeping his eyes fixed on the ground.\n\"You know quite well.\"\n\"I do not, Harry.\"\n[6] \"Well, I will tell you what it is.\"\n\"Please don't.\"\n\"I must. I want you to explain to me why you won't exhibit Dorian Gray's picture. I want the real\nreason.\"\n\"I told you the real reason.\"\n\"No, you did not. You said it was because there was too much of yourself in it. Now, that is\nchildish.\"\n\"Harry,\" said Basil Hallward, looking him straight in the face, \"every portrait that is painted with\nfeeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is\nnot he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on the colored canvas, reveals\nhimself. The reason I will not exhibit this picture is that I am afraid that I have shown with it the\nsecret of my own soul.\"\nLord Harry laughed. \"And what is that?\" he asked.\n\"I will tell you,\" said Hallward; and an expression of perplexity came over his face.\n\"I am all expectation, Basil,\" murmured his companion, looking at him.\n\"Oh, there is really very little to tell, Harry,\" answered the young painter; \"and I am afraid you\nwill hardly understand it. Perhaps you will hardly believe it.\"\nLord Henry smiled, and, leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled daisy from the grass, and\nexamined it. \"I am quite sure I shall understand it,\" he replied, gazing intently at the little golden\nwhite-feathered disk, \"and I can believe anything, provided that it is incredible.\"\nThe wind shook some blossoms from the trees, and the heavy lilac blooms, with their clustering\nstars, moved to and fro in the languid air. A grasshopper began to chirrup in the grass, and a long thin\ndragon-fly floated by on its brown gauze wings. Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward's\nheart beating, and he wondered what was coming.\n\"Well, this is incredible,\" repeated Hallward, rather bitterly,--\"incredible to me at times. I don't\nknow what it means. The story is simply this. Two months ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandon's.\nYou know we poor painters have to show ourselves in society from time to time, just to remind the\npublic that we are not savages. With an evening coat and a white tie, as you told me once, anybody,\neven a stock-broker, can gain a reputation for being civilized. Well, after I had been in the room about\nten minutes, talking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious Academicians, I suddenly became\nconscious that some one was looking at me. I turned half-way round, and saw Dorian Gray for the first\ntime. When our eyes met, I felt that I was growing pale. A curious instinct of terror came over me. I\nknew that I had come face to face with some one whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if I\nallowed it to do so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art itself. I did not want\nany external influence in my life. You know yourself, Harry, how independent I am by nature. My\nfather destined me for the army. I insisted on [7] going to Oxford. Then he made me enter my name at\nthe Middle Temple. Before I had eaten half a dozen dinners I gave up the Bar, and announced my\nintention of becoming a painter. I have always been my own master; had at least always been so, till I\nmet Dorian Gray. Then--But I don't know how to explain it to you. Something seemed to tell me that I\nwas on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life. I had a strange feeling that Fate had in store for me\nexquisite joys and exquisite sorrows. I knew that if I spoke to Dorian I would become absolutely\ndevoted to him, and that I ought not to speak to him. I grew afraid, and turned to quit the room. It was\nnot conscience that made me do so: it was cowardice. I take no credit to myself for trying to escape.\"\n\"Conscience and cowardice are really the same things, Basil. Conscience is the trade-name of the\nfirm. That is all.\"\n\"I don't believe that, Harry. However, whatever was my motive,--and it may have been pride, for I\nused to be very proud,--I certainly struggled to the door. There, of course, I stumbled against Lady\nBrandon. 'You are not going to run away so soon, Mr. Hallward?' she screamed out. You know her\nshrill horrid voice?\"\n\"Yes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty,\" said Lord Henry, pulling the daisy to bits with\nhis long, nervous fingers.\n\"I could not get rid of her. She brought me up to Royalties, and people with Stars and Garters, and\nelderly ladies with gigantic tiaras and hooked noses. She spoke of me as her dearest friend. I had only\nmet her once before, but she took it into her head to lionize me. I believe some picture of mine had\nmade a great success at the time, at least had been chattered about in the penny newspapers, which is\nthe nineteenth-century standard of immortality. Suddenly I found myself face to face with the young\nman whose personality had so strangely stirred me. We were quite close, almost touching. Our eyes\nmet again. It was mad of me, but I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him. Perhaps it was not so\nmad, after all. It was simply inevitable. We would have spoken to each other without any introduction.\nI am sure of that. Dorian told me so afterwards. He, too, felt that we were destined to know each\nother.\"\n\"And how did Lady Brandon describe this wonderful young man? I know she goes in for giving a\nrapid précis of all her guests. I remember her bringing me up to a most truculent and red-faced old\ngentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons, and hissing into my ear, in a tragic whisper which\nmust have been perfectly audible to everybody in the room, something like 'Sir Humpty Dumpty--you\nknow--Afghan frontier--Russian intrigues: very successful man--wife killed by an elephant--quite\ninconsolable--wants to marry a beautiful American widow--everybody does nowadays--hates Mr.\nGladstone--but very much interested in beetles: ask him what he thinks of Schouvaloff.' I simply fled.\nI like to find out people for myself. But poor Lady Brandon treats her guests exactly as an auctioneer\ntreats his goods. She either explains them entirely away, or tells one everything about them except\nwhat one wants to know. But what did she say about Mr. Dorian Gray?\"\n[8] \"Oh, she murmured, 'Charming boy--poor dear mother and I quite inseparable--engaged to be\nmarried to the same man--I mean married on the same day--how very silly of me! Quite forget what\nhe does--afraid he--doesn't do anything--oh, yes, plays the piano--or is it the violin, dear Mr. Gray?'\nWe could neither of us help laughing, and we became friends at once.\"\n\"Laughter is not a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is the best ending for one,\" said Lord\nHenry, plucking another daisy.\nHallward buried his face in his hands. \"You don't understand what friendship is, Harry,\" he\nmurmured,--\"or what enmity is, for that matter. You like every one; that is to say, you are indifferent\nto every one.\"\n\"How horribly unjust of you!\" cried Lord Henry, tilting his hat back, and looking up at the little\nclouds that were drifting across the hollowed turquoise of the summer sky, like ravelled skeins of\nglossy white silk. \"Yes; horribly unjust of you. I make a great difference between people. I choose my\nfriends for their good looks, my acquaintances for their characters, and my enemies for their brains. A\nman can't be too careful in the choice of his enemies. I have not got one who is a fool. They are all\nmen of some intellectual power, and consequently they all appreciate me. Is that very vain of me? I\nthink it is rather vain.\"\n\"I should think it was, Harry. But according to your category I must be merely an acquaintance.\"\n\"My dear old Basil, you are much more than an acquaintance.\"\n\"And much less than a friend. A sort of brother, I suppose?\"\n\"Oh, brothers! I don't care for brothers. My elder brother won't die, and my younger brothers seem\nnever to do anything else.\"\n\"Harry!\"\n\"My dear fellow, I am not quite serious. But I can't help detesting my relations. I suppose it comes\nfrom the fact that we can't stand other people having the same faults as ourselves. I quite sympathize\nwith the rage of the English democracy against what they call the vices of the upper classes. They feel\nthat drunkenness, stupidity, and immorality should be their own special property, and that if any one\nof us makes an ass of himself he is poaching on their preserves. When poor Southwark got into the\nDivorce Court, their indignation was quite magnificent. And yet I don't suppose that ten per cent of the\nlower orders live correctly.\"\n\"I don't agree with a single word that you have said, and, what is more, Harry, I don't believe you\ndo either.\"\n\nLord Henry stroked his pointed brown beard, and tapped the toe of his patent-leather boot with a\ntasselled malacca cane. \"How English you are, Basil! If one puts forward an idea to a real\nEnglishman,--always a rash thing to do,--he never dreams of considering whether the idea is right or\nwrong. The only thing he considers of any importance is whether one believes it one's self. Now, the\nvalue of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with the sincerity of the man who expresses it. Indeed,\nthe probabilities are that the more insincere the man is, the more purely intellectual will the idea be,\nas in that case it [9] will not be colored by either his wants, his desires, or his prejudices. However, I\ndon't propose to discuss politics, sociology, or metaphysics with you. I like persons better than\nprinciples. Tell me more about Dorian Gray. How often do you see him?\"\n\"Every day. I couldn't be happy if I didn't see him every day. Of course sometimes it is only for a\nfew minutes. But a few minutes with somebody one worships mean a great deal.\"\n\"But you don't really worship him?\"\n\"I do.\"\n\"How extraordinary! I thought you would never care for anything but your painting,--your art, I\nshould say. Art sounds better, doesn't it?\"\n\"He is all my art to me now. I sometimes think, Harry, that there are only two eras of any\nimportance in the history of the world. The first is the appearance of a new medium for art, and the\nsecond is the appearance of a new personality for art also. What the invention of oil-painting was to\nthe Venetians, the face of Antinoüs was to late Greek sculpture, and the face of Dorian Gray will some\nday be to me. It is not merely that I paint from him, draw from him, model from him. Of course I have\ndone all that. He has stood as Paris in dainty armor, and as Adonis with huntsman's cloak and polished\nboar-spear. Crowned with heavy lotus-blossoms, he has sat on the prow of Adrian's barge, looking into\nthe green, turbid Nile. He has leaned over the still pool of some Greek woodland, and seen in the\nwater's silent silver the wonder of his own beauty. But he is much more to me than that. I won't tell\nyou that I am dissatisfied with what I have done of him, or that his beauty is such that art cannot\nexpress it. There is nothing that art cannot express, and I know that the work I have done since I met\nDorian Gray is good work, is the best work of my life. But in some curious way--I wonder will you\nunderstand me?--his personality has suggested to me an entirely new manner in art, an entirely new\nmode of style. I see things differently, I think of them differently. I can now re-create life in a way\nthat was hidden from me before. 'A dream of form in days of thought,'--who is it who says that? I\nforget; but it is what Dorian Gray has been to me. The merely visible presence of this lad,--for he\nseems to me little more than a lad, though he is really over twenty,--his merely visible presence,--ah! I\nwonder can you realize all that that means? Unconsciously he defines for me the lines of a fresh\nschool, a school that is to have in itself all the passion of the romantic spirit, all the perfection of the\nspirit that is Greek. The harmony of soul and body,--how much that is! We in our madness have\nseparated the two, and have invented a realism that is bestial, an ideality that is void. Harry! Harry! if\nyou only knew what Dorian Gray is to me! You remember that landscape of mine, for which Agnew\noffered me such a huge price, but which I would not part with? It is one of the best things I have ever\ndone. And why is it so? Because, while I was painting it, Dorian Gray sat beside me.\"\n\"Basil, this is quite wonderful! I must see Dorian Gray.\" Hallward got up from the seat, and\nwalked up and down the [10] garden. After some time he came back. \"You don't understand, Harry,\"\nhe said. \"Dorian Gray is merely to me a motive in art. He is never more present in my work than when\nno image of him is there. He is simply a suggestion, as I have said, of a new manner. I see him in the\ncurves of certain lines, in the loveliness and the subtleties of certain colors. That is all.\"\n\"Then why won't you exhibit his portrait?\"\n\"Because I have put into it all the extraordinary romance of which, of course, I have never dared to\nspeak to him. He knows nothing about it. He will never know anything about it. But the world might\nguess it; and I will not bare my soul to their shallow, prying eyes. My heart shall never be put under\ntheir microscope. There is too much of myself in the thing, Harry,--too much of myself!\"\n\"Poets are not so scrupulous as you are. They know how useful passion is for publication.\nNowadays a broken heart will run to many editions.\"\n\"I hate them for it. An artist should create beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life\ninto them. We live in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of autobiography. We\nhave lost the abstract sense of beauty. If I live, I will show the world what it is; and for that reason the\nworld shall never see my portrait of Dorian Gray.\"\n\"I think you are wrong, Basil, but I won't argue with you. It is only the intellectually lost who ever\nargue. Tell me, is Dorian Gray very fond of you?\"\nHallward considered for a few moments. \"He likes me,\" he answered, after a pause; \"I know he\nlikes me. Of course I flatter him dreadfully. I find a strange pleasure in saying things to him that I\nknow I shall be sorry for having said. I give myself away. As a rule, he is charming to me, and we\nwalk home together from the club arm in arm, or sit in the studio and talk of a thousand things. Now\nand then, however, he is horribly thoughtless, and seems to take a real delight in giving me pain. Then\nI feel, Harry, that I have given away my whole soul to some one who treats it as if it were a flower to\nput in his coat, a bit of decoration to charm his vanity, an ornament for a summer's day.\"\n\"Days in summer, Basil, are apt to linger. Perhaps you will tire sooner than he will. It is a sad\nthing to think of, but there is no doubt that Genius lasts longer than Beauty. That accounts for the fact\nthat we all take such pains to over-educate ourselves. In the wild struggle for existence, we want to\nhave something that endures, and so we fill our minds with rubbish and facts, in the silly hope of\nkeeping our place. The thoroughly well informed man,--that is the modern ideal. And the mind of the\nthoroughly well informed man is a dreadful thing. It is like a bric-à-brac shop, all monsters and dust,\nand everything priced above its proper value. I think you will tire first, all the same. Some day you\nwill look at Gray, and he will seem to you to be a little out of drawing, or you won't like his tone of\ncolor, or something. You will bitterly reproach him in your own heart, and seriously think that he has\nbehaved very badly to you. The next time he calls, you will be [11] perfectly cold and indifferent. It\nwill be a great pity, for it will alter you. The worst of having a romance is that it leaves one so\nunromantic.\"\n\"Harry, don't talk like that. As long as I live, the personality of Dorian Gray will dominate me.\nYou can't feel what I feel. You change too often.\"\n\"Ah, my dear Basil, that is exactly why I can feel it. Those who are faithful know only the\npleasures of love: it is the faithless who know love's tragedies.\" And Lord Henry struck a light on a\ndainty silver case, and began to smoke a cigarette with a self-conscious and self-satisfied air, as if he\nhad summed up life in a phrase. There was a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the ivy, and the blue\ncloud-shadows chased themselves across the grass like swallows. How pleasant it was in the garden!\nAnd how delightful other people's emotions were!--much more delightful than their ideas, it seemed\nto him. One's own soul, and the passions of one's friends,--those were the fascinating things in life. He\nthought with pleasure of the tedious luncheon that he had missed by staying so long with Basil\nHallward. Had he gone to his aunt's, he would have been sure to meet Lord Goodbody there, and the\nwhole conversation would have been about the housing of the poor, and the necessity for model\nlodging-houses. It was charming to have escaped all that! As he thought of his aunt, an idea seemed to\nstrike him. He turned to Hallward, and said, \"My dear fellow, I have just remembered.\"\n\"Remembered what, Harry?\"\n\"Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray.\"\n\"Where was it?\" asked Hallward, with a slight frown.\n\"Don't look so angry, Basil. It was at my aunt's, Lady Agatha's. She told me she had discovered a\nwonderful young man, who was going to help her in the East End, and that his name was Dorian Gray.\nI am bound to state that she never told me he was good-looking. Women have no appreciation of good\nlooks. At least, good women have not. She said that he was very earnest, and had a beautiful nature. I\nat once pictured to myself a creature with spectacles and lank hair, horridly freckled, and tramping\nabout on huge feet. I wish I had known it was your friend.\"\n\"I am very glad you didn't, Harry.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"I don't want you to meet him.\"\n\"Mr. Dorian Gray is in the studio, sir,\" said the butler, coming into the garden.\n\"You must introduce me now,\" cried Lord Henry, laughing.\nBasil Hallward turned to the servant, who stood blinking in the sunlight. \"Ask Mr. Gray to wait,\nParker: I will be in in a few moments.\" The man bowed, and went up the walk.\nThen he looked at Lord Henry. \"Dorian Gray is my dearest friend,\" he said. \"He has a simple and a\nbeautiful nature. Your aunt was quite right in what she said of him. Don't spoil him for me. Don't try\nto influence him. Your influence would be bad. The world is wide, and has many marvellous people in\nit. Don't take [12] away from me the one person that makes life absolutely lovely to me, and that gives\nto my art whatever wonder or charm it possesses. Mind, Harry, I trust you.\" He spoke very slowly, and\nthe words seemed wrung out of him almost against his will.\n\"What nonsense you talk!\" said Lord Henry, smiling, and, taking Hallward by the arm, he almost\nled him into the house.\n[End of text]"

      "Extract all of the percentages from the following text and list them in ascending order with bullet points.  Provide one word next to each percentage related to what the percentage is referring to. Bold the smallest and largest numbers. \n\nGiant cell tumor (GCT) is one of the most common benign bone tumors, predominantly occurring in young adults aged 20 to 40 with a high recurrence rate and the potential for aggressive behavior.[1] Typically found at the metaphyseal or epiphyseal regions of the tibia or femur, GCT, despite its predominantly benign nature, exhibits a highly unpredictable spectrum of disease behavior. Local aggressiveness varies from focal symptoms arising from bony or cortical destruction and surrounding soft tissue expansion to the rare occurrence of metastasis. Instances of GCT within the axial skeleton pose a heightened risk of severe local complications and are often deemed unresectable.[2]\n\nUnder the microscope, the biopsied tissue reveals multinucleated giant cells comprising 3 distinct cell types: \n\nGiant cell tumor stromal cells originating from osteoblasts\nMononuclear histiocytic cells\nMultinucleated giant cells belonging to an osteoclast-monocyte lineage [3] \nThe giant cells carry out the primary task of tumor bone resorption within the tumor. The spindle-like stromal cells are pivotal in recruiting monocytes and facilitating their fusion into giant cells. The stromal cells also improve the resorptive capabilities of the giant cells, contributing to the overall bone resorption mechanism.\n\nGo to:\nEtiology\nThe precise etiology of GCT is not fully understood, and there is ongoing debate about whether it represents a true neoplasm or a reactive condition. Notably, a 20q11 amplification is seen in 54% of GCTs, and 20% of cases exhibit over-expression of p53. Centrosome amplification and boosted telomerase activity, coupled with the prevention of telomere shortening, provide evidence supporting a neoplastic origin.[4][5][6]\n\nGo to:\nEpidemiology\nGCTs represent 4% to 10% of all primary bone tumors and 15% to 20% of benign bone tumors [7], with a preference for affecting young adults. Approximately half of these tumors occur in individuals during their third and fourth decades of life, with rarity observed in those older than 50. There is a female-to-male ratio between 1.3 and 1.5 to 1, and the incidence is higher among Asian populations than in Western populations. Among the reported cases, 44% are situated around the knee joint, 10% in the distal radius, 6% in the proximal humerus, and 13% in the hands and feet.[7] The spine and skull are rarely affected. In the axial skeleton, the ala of the sacrum is the most common location, and when the spine is involved, the vertebral body is the most commonly affected. The mandible and maxilla are preferred in the head, while in the hand, GCTs frequently occur in the phalanges.\n\nAlthough benign, GCTs exhibit locally aggressive behavior and have the potential to metastasize. Around 1% to 5% of cases show metastasis, with a notable positive correlation between the occurrence of metastases and local aggressiveness and recurrence.[8] The lungs are the most common site for metastases.[9] Varying degrees of local aggressiveness, ranging from simple cortical breakthrough to extension into surrounding soft tissues and articular structures, can cause severe and debilitating local complications. The risk of recurrence is approximately 35%.[10]\n\nThe tumor typically occurs sporadically before the age of 20, with less than 5% of cases presenting in skeletally immature patients.[11] A higher incidence of vertebral GCT and multicentricity is noted in patients with skeletal immaturity. Although less common, multifocal lesions exhibit more aggressiveness than solitary lesions.[12] In individuals with Paget disease, there is an elevated occurrence of GCT, with a preference for flat bones like the skull and pelvis.[13]"

Then make a separate list of all individuals mentioned in the text, putting the conflict that they are associated with in parentheses and the dates in bold. Put this in alphabetical order, using a numbered list.\n\nHostilities between England and France in North America resumed from 1702 to 1713, known as Queen Anne's War. The siege of Port Royal took place in 1710, ending French rule in peninsular Acadia. The subsequent signing of the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 formally recognized British rule in the region, while returning Cape Breton Island (Île Royale) and Prince Edward Island (Île Saint-Jean) to the French. Despite the British conquest of Acadia in 1710, Nova Scotia remained primarily occupied by Catholic Acadians and Mi'kmaq, who confined British forces to Annapolis and to Canso. Present-day New Brunswick formed a part of the French colony of Acadia. Immediately after the capture of Port Royal in 1710, Francis Nicholson announced it would be renamed Annapolis Royal in honour of Queen Anne.\n\nAs a result of Father Rale's War (1722–1725), the Mi'kmaq signed a series of treaties with the British in 1725. The Mi'kmaq signed a treaty of submission to the British crown.[24][25] However, conflict between the Acadians, Mi'kmaq, French and the British persisted in the following decades with King George's War (1744–1748).\n\nFather Le Loutre's War (1749–1755) began when Edward Cornwallis arrived to establish Halifax with 13 transports on 21 June 1749.[26][27] A General Court, made up of the governor and the council, was the highest court in the colony at the time.[28] Jonathan Belcher was sworn in as chief justice of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court on 21 October 1754.[28] The first legislative assembly in Halifax, under the Governorship of Charles Lawrence, met on 2 October 1758.[29]\n\nDuring the French and Indian War of 1754–1763 (the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War), the British deported the Acadians and recruited New England Planters to resettle the colony. The 75-year period of war ended with the Halifax Treaties between the British and the Mi'kmaq (1761). After the war, some Acadians were allowed to return.\n\nIn 1763, most of Acadia (Cape Breton Island, St. John's Island (now Prince Edward Island), and New Brunswick) became part of Nova Scotia. In 1765, the county of Sunbury was created. This included the territory of present-day New Brunswick and eastern Maine as far as the Penobscot River. In 1769, St. John's Island became a separate colony.[30]\n\nThe American Revolution (1775–1783) had a significant impact on shaping Nova Scotia, with the colony initially displaying ambivalence over whether the colony should join the revolution; Rebellion flared at the Battle of Fort Cumberland (1776) and at the Siege of Saint John (1777). Throughout the war, American privateers devastated the maritime economy by capturing ships and looting almost every community outside of Halifax. These American raids alienated many sympathetic or neutral Nova Scotians into supporting the British. By the end of the war, Nova Scotia had outfitted numerous privateers to attack American shipping.[31]\n\nBritish military forces based at Halifax succeeded in preventing an American occupation of Nova Scotia, though the Royal Navy failed to establish naval supremacy in the region. While the British captured many American privateers in battles such as the Naval battle off Halifax (1782), many more continued attacks on shipping and settlements until the final months of the war. The Royal Navy struggled to maintain British supply lines, defending British convoys from American and French attacks as in the fiercely fought convoy battle, the Naval battle off Cape Breton (1781).\n\nAfter the Americans and their French allies won at the siege of Yorktown in 1781, approximately 33,000 Loyalists (the King's Loyal Americans, allowed to place \"United Empire Loyalist\" after their names) settled in Nova Scotia (14,000 of them in what became New Brunswick) on lands granted by the Crown as some compensation for their losses. (The British administration divided Nova Scotia and hived off Cape Breton and New Brunswick in 1784.) The Loyalist exodus created new communities across Nova Scotia, including Shelburne, which briefly became one of the larger British settlements in North America, and infused Nova Scotia with additional capital and skills.\n\nThe migration caused political tensions between Loyalist leaders and the leaders of the existing New England Planters settlement. The Loyalist influx also pushed Nova Scotia's 2000 Mi'kmaq People to the margins as Loyalist land grants encroached on ill-defined native lands. As part of the Loyalist migration, about 3,000 Black Loyalists arrived; they founded the largest free Black settlement in North America at Birchtown, near Shelburne. There are several Black Loyalists buried in unmarked graves in the Old Burying Ground in Halifax. Many Nova Scotian communities were settled by British regiments that fought in the war."

He would develop a brief habit of wearing three neckties at a time, which he understands to have been a manifestation of his personal insecurity.[12] He also points to a particular image from his childhood that shaped his understanding of the world—\"[my youth] was a dream world, those droning airplanes, blue skies, picket fences, green grass, cherry trees.

So you see, there's this beautiful world and you just look a little bit closer and it's all red ants\".[13]\nFinding the calm and contented nature of his home life frustrating, the young Lynch sought ways to secretly rebel against his parents. He and a friend took to building bottle rockets; after a particularly powerful rocket severely damaged his friend's foot they switched their focus to making and detonating pipe bombs for fun instead. A large pipe bomb which they detonated in a school swimming pool was heard by several neighbors, and resulted in Lynch and his friend being arrested.[14] Lynch was also a member of the high school fraternity Alpha Omega Upsilon, and learned to play the bongos while frequenting a nightclub popular with the Beat Generation, earning the nickname \"Bongo Dave\".[15]\n\nList all of the adjectives in the above text.

Additionally, oneself cannot produce a smoke signal.  \n   - Based on the observation that signals A, B, and C are equidistant from each other, while signal D is stronger and closer, this distinguishes it from the other signals.

The flight to Nairobi departs later than the flight to Buenos Aires, so the flight to Buenos Aires departs at 8:00, and the flight to Nairobi departs at 8:40.  \n② The 12:20 flight's destination is in the Western Hemisphere (i.e., Chicago, Montreal, or Buenos Aires). Since we have already determined that the flight to Buenos Aires departs at 8:00, the 12:20 flight's destination could only be Chicago or Montreal.  \n③ The flight to Munich departs one hour later than the flight to Cairo. The departure times that are exactly one hour apart are 12:20 and 13:20, as well as 15:45 and 16:45. The flight to Cairo cannot depart at 12:20, which means the flight to Cairo must depart at 15:45, and the flight to Munich departs at 16:45.  \n④ The destination city of the 13:20 flight starts with the letter \"C\" (i.e., Chicago, Copenhagen, or Cairo), so the 13:20 flight's destination could only be Chicago or Copenhagen.  \n⑤ Flights to Asia do not depart in the morning. The Asian destinations are Beijing and Kyoto. The flight to Beijing departs after the flight to Kyoto, so the 14:30 flight's destination is Kyoto, and the 17:00 flight's destination is Beijing.",

Imagine a 3 x 3 grid, and each cell in the grid contains a number.  I will describe a few of the known cell values, and you will figure out the rest of them following a set of rules.\n\nIn this version of the game, the number in each cell will have 1 or 2 digits.

      "I am trying to figure out whether a student in my class used artificial intelligence to cheat on the midterm essay. I have an AI detector, but it isn't perfect. When I submit AI-written text to the detector, it has an 85% chance of detecting that it was AI-written. When I submit human-written text, it has a 20% chance of giving me a false positive result. Last semester, 40 students out of 200 in total used AI to cheat on the midterm, but my college's policy on AI use has gotten a lot harsher since then, so I think that only a quarter as many of my students will use AI to cheat this semester. \n\nThe AI detector told me that the student used AI. What is the probability that they actually did? Think step by step.",
      "1. First, define the events:\n   - Let \\(A\\) be the event that the student used AI to write the essay.\n   - Let \\(D\\) be the event that the AI detector indicates that the student used AI.\n2. Calculate the prior probabilities \\(P(A)\\) and \\(P(\\neg A)\\):\n   - Last semester, the proportion of students who used AI was \\(\\frac{40}{200}=0.2\\). Since the college's policy has gotten harsher and only a quarter as many students are expected to use AI this semester, the prior probability that a student uses AI, \\(P(A)=0.2\\times\\frac{1}{4}=0.05\\).\n   - The probability that a student did not use AI is \\(P(\\neg A)=1 - P(A)=1 - 0.05 = 0.95\\).\n3. Calculate the conditional probabilities \\(P(D|A)\\) and \\(P(D|\\neg A)\\):\n   - The probability that the detector detects AI-written text when it is actually AI-written is \\(P(D|A)=0.85\\).\n   - The probability of a false positive (the detector says the text is AI-written when it is actually human-written) is \\(P(D|\\neg A)=0.2\\).\n4. Then, use Bayes' theorem:\n   - Bayes' theorem states that \\(P(A|D)=\\frac{P(D|A)P(A)}{P(D|A)P(A)+P(D|\\neg A)P(\\neg A)}\\).\n   - Calculate the numerator: \\(P(D|A)P(A)=0.85\\times0.05 = 0.0425\\).\n   - Calculate the denominator:\n     - \\(P(D|A)P(A)+P(D|\\neg A)P(\\neg A)=0.85\\times0.05+0.2\\times0.95\\).\n     - First, \\(0.85\\times0.05 = 0.0425\\) and \\(0.2\\times0.95 = 0.19\\).\n     - Then, \\(0.0425 + 0.19=0.2325\\).\n5. Finally, find \\(P(A|D)\\):\n   - \\(P(A|D)=\\frac{0.0425}{0.2325}\\approx0.183\\).\n\n\nSo the probability that the student actually used AI given that the detector indicated they did is approximately \\(0.183\\) or \\(18.3\\%\\).",
      "Wow, that's more than I thought it would be! I only want to go to the administration if it's more than 50% likely that he cheated. How low would the false positive rate need to be for that to be true, assuming that nothing else changed?",
      "1. Let the false positive rate be \\(x\\).\n   - We still have \\(P(A) = 0.05\\) (the probability that a student uses AI), \\(P(\\neg A)=0.95\\) (the probability that a student does not use AI), and \\(P(D|A) = 0.85\\) (the probability that the detector correctly detects AI-written text).\n   - By Bayes' theorem, \\(P(A|D)=\\frac{P(D|A)P(A)}{P(D|A)P(A)+P(D|\\neg A)P(\\neg A)}\\).\n   - We want \\(P(A|D)>0.5\\). Substituting the known values into Bayes' theorem, we get \\(\\frac{0.85\\times0.05}{0.85\\times0.05 + x\\times0.95}>0.5\\).\n2. First, simplify the left-hand side of the inequality:\n   - The numerator is \\(0.85\\times0.05 = 0.0425\\).\n   - The denominator is \\(0.0425+0.95x\\).\n   - So the inequality becomes \\(\\frac{0.0425}{0.0425 + 0.95x}>0.5\\).\n3. Cross-multiply the inequality:\n   - Since \\(0.0425+0.95x>0\\) (because probabilities are non-negative), cross-multiplying gives \\(0.0425>0.5\\times(0.0425 + 0.95x)\\).\n4. Expand the right-hand side of the inequality:\n   - \\(0.0425>0.02125+0.475x\\).\n5. Subtract \\(0.02125\\) from both sides:\n   - \\(0.0425 - 0.02125>0.475x\\).\n   - \\(0.02125>0.475x\\).\n6. Solve for \\(x\\):\n   - Divide both sides by \\(0.475\\): \\(x<\\frac{0.02125}{0.475}\\).\n   - \\(x < 0.0447\\).\n\n\nSo the false positive rate would need to be less than approximately \\(4.47\\%\\) for the probability that the student actually cheated, given that the detector indicated cheating, to be more than \\(50\\%\\). ",
      "Wow, that sounds really hard! What if I keep the false positive rate the same as it was originally, but increase the rate of *correctly* detecting AI responses higher? (All other values will stay the same.) What would the true positive detection rate need to be for that to work, and would that likely be easier or harder than decreasing the false positive rate?

      "I am standing on one side of a slanted bridge. Below the bridge is molten lava which will distintegrate my entire body the moment I touch it. However, the slanted bridge is made up of a series of steps that fall as soon as I touch them - this means that I need to run across the bridge in order to survive the crossing. I can only run for 10 seconds before I collapse, and I can run 3 feet per second. The slanted bridge is actually two right-triangles of the exact same size which are connected, with the apex of the bridge being the center-point where the two triangles connect. I know the horizontal length from one side of the bridge to the other is 28 feet. I also know that the angle that I am standing next to measures 31 degrees.\n\nKnowing all of this information, I need to know what the total distance from one side of the bridge to the other is, how long it will take me to cross it, and whether or not I can make it before I collapse from exhaustion.

To sum up: all communication of mental meanings is language, communication in words being only a particular case of human language and of justice, poetry, or whatever underlying it or founded it. The existence of language, however, is not coextensive with all the areas of human mental expression in which language is always in one sense or another inherent, but with absolutely everything.\""

      "I'd like you to classify the following product reviews as either positive or negative.\n\n1. I bought a shark matrix plus robot hoover 21/12/2025 and have used the item possibly 4/5 times. The item is now faulty and doesn't work. I have been trying to contact shark as we have a warranty on the item but after several calls and being left on hold for around an hour 20 each time I gave up and put the phone down. I along with most other people work during the day and can't sit on the phone for several hours waiting for an answer.\nTerrible service and I have spent £300 on an item that doesn't work and can't return it to asda where it was bought as they are telling me I need to contact shark!!\n2. My Shark hoover needed a new motor - it was still under 5 year guarantee. The man on customer services was delightful - all new motors were out of stock, so he offered me a new hoover!! I sent the old one back and received a new one. The whole operation was completed in under a week!\nChecked my account and the new hoover has already been registered with a new 5 years warranty.\nThank you Shark - amazing customer service!!\n3. The plug pin broke and after calling Shark helpline, a new base unit was received the following day. Excellent service\n4. I’ve contacted shark about a faulty vacuum and I’ve had no reply. Battery lasts minutes only and I’ve only had it since November 24. Will now take it up with my bank instead\nFuming\n5. Had a problem with an older shark vacuum cleaner. Their customer service agents were both fantastic and sorted the part out for me, despite it being a few days out of guarantee. They were both professional and extremely helpful. Would definitely recommend shark on the basis of the excellent customer service!\n6. I would not buy again!\nWe have an upright hoover. When you first get it it’s amazing then after a while as much as you clean the filters and everything else, it just loses suction.\nI’ve had two new motors and still this happens.\nA high maintenance hoover!\n7. Purchased the Shark Detect Pro and haven't looked back. It was easy to setup, use and the auto empty system means I only need to empty the vacuum monthly.\n\nIt's easy to use on all surfaces and so far no issues.\n8. We purchased a shark animal cordless upright thinking it was just the thing to wizz around on a daily basis, sadly not sure what is wrong with ours but its had issues with collecting pet hair from the outset and has stopped working altogether after having it 2yrs\nI wouldnt recommend if you have dogs\n9. Shark Iz202uk - excellent!\nThis anti hair wrap vacuum cleaner works!\nI’ve had 2 Dyson cleaners - short lived batteries and clogged up heads.\nThe Shark battery lasts ages and the anti hair wrap works. Very powerful too\nVery pleased\n10. 101008034736 & 101008001966 both these orders was sent out using yodel both these deliveries have not been made\ni asked shark not to use same delivery company for second item as the first\nbut they cannot choose who they use now as i speak i am 2 items down with no help from shark but a refund i have spent 3 days in awaiting these products but will never buy a shark product again there customer service is a negative or no go area"

      "How would you classify the sentiment of this book review? I want to know if the book is worth reading.\n\nReview:\n\n\"Some books fall far short of the ideal. I recall with horror, when my kids were little, picking up a collection of Enid Blyton short stories and reading one to them, hoping to relive my childhood memories. I was aghast at the moral messages from that author. How the hell had we ever thought that was acceptable? The book was put back on the shelf, never to be touched again.\n\nI’ve put off reading Richard Adam’s ‘Watership Down’ for a long while as a result of this. I loved the movie as a child, Art Garfunkel’s haunting voice singing Mike Batt’s beautiful ‘Bright Eyes’ still brings tears to my eyes. I read the book somewhere around the age of ten – probably way too young though somehow I understood every word even if I hadn’t a clue what the classic references starting every chapter were all about. I loved it and, indeed I still have the book – sans front cover lost in the midst of time. It is this copy I read for this review.\n\nI’m pleased to say that Mr Adams came up to scratch. ‘Watership Down’ is still an exquisitely beautiful story and the writing remains impeccable.\n\nThe book, frankly, shouldn’t exist. It’s a story about bunnies which puts it firmly in the ‘for children’ category, and yet the writing is unmistakably for adults. I may have managed it (I was a precocious boy who devoured books far too old for him) but I didn’t get all the nuances. Plus, in the end, the storyline is rather horrific in many ways. Fiver the rabbit has premonitions that death is coming to the warren, which leads to his brother, Hazel, leading a small group of them out of their home and into the danger of the wild. Of course, Fiver is right – but they have not at all escaped death themselves. This is no bedtime tales for small children.\n\nBlended into all this are tales of Frith, who created the world, and El-ahrairah, the first rabbit; and let’s not forget the Black Rabbit too. I can’t begin to see how children might respond to it all but adults seemingly love it. These strange, yet delightful stories give us a fascinating insight into…rabbits? No, of course not (though the author clearly knows the life and habit of these creatures), but our own way of thinking, for sure. You can decide on how far you want to go down this, as it were, rabbit hole. The book is wonderful just as a tale of rabbits searching for a mythical place of peace and security, or you can see it as an anthropomorphical tour-de-force of philosophy questioning our own understanding of God.\n\nEither way, this is just such a lovely book. Richard Adams somehow manages to inject into the pages the smells, sounds and feel of the English countryside. Reading the story makes you feel like you are actually outside on a glorious English summer day. Episodes which should be silly in the cold light of day (they’re just bunnies for heaven’s sake!) leave you, at the very least, teary-eyed. And God help me if I start to hear ‘Bright eyes, burning like fire…’ in my head. I’m not crying, you’re crying.\""

      "Create categories for these excerpts based on what Philosopher said it: \nThe failure and disillusion came — swift and bitter, Yet victorious Sparta did not destroy, or even utterly and permanently humble, her nobler rival. Throughout Plato’s matured life Athens was again self-governed ; she had regained a fleet, some commerce, and even a modest leadership in a maritime league, though never her pristine haughtiness and far-reaching hopes. Her people looked backward, rather than forward, with fond pride. Their instinct was right. Macedon, nottica, was to lead Hellenism to world-wide dominion, though the culture, the art, and the speech of the race were to remain always essentially Attic.\n\nWilt thou, then, my soul, never be good and simple and one and naked, more manifest than the body which surrounds thee? Wilt thou never enjoy an affectionate and contented disposition? Wilt thou never be full and without a want of any kind, longing for nothing more, nor desiring anything, either animate or inanimate, for the enjoyment of pleasures? Nor yet desiring time wherein thou shalt have longer enjoyment, or place, or pleasant climate, or society of men with whom thou mayest live in harmony? But wilt thou be satisfied with thy present condition, and pleased with all that is about thee, and wilt thou convince thyself that thou hast everything and that it comes from the gods,…\n\nDemonstration can be made in two ways: One is through the cause, and is called \"a priori,\" and this is to argue from what is prior absolutely. The other is through the effect, and is called a demonstration \"a posteriori\"; this is to argue from what is prior relatively only to us. When an effect is better known to us than its cause, from the effect we proceed to the knowledge of the cause. And from every effect the existence of its proper cause can be demonstrated, so long as its effects are better known to us; because since every effect depends upon its cause, if the effect exists, the cause must pre-exist. Hence the existence of God, in so far as it is not self-evident to us, can be demonstrated from those of His effects which are known to us.\n"

      "Classify the provided text. What type of text is it? Also classify the sentiment within this text. Answer using 200-300 words. \n\nMikel Arteta waited 84 minutes to make a substitution in this damaging draw with Aston Villa, and when he finally broke glass, his only tool was a blunt Raheem Sterling. For all Sterling’s known talents, he is a 30-year-old winger of fading impact and it was enough to wonder whether the player he was replacing, an utterly shattered Gabriel Martinelli, might still have been the better option as the minutes ticked away.\n\nArsenal’s lack of depth right now doesn’t entirely explain how they contrived to draw this game 2-2, having led 2-0 after an hour, as mighty chunks of their title bid crumbled away. Aston Villa deserve plenty of credit. But it was conspicuous that where Arteta made only one substitution, just minutes before kick-off here, Liverpool had snatched victory at Brentford thanks to a £60m substitute, Darwin Nunez, one of five luxury second-half changes by Arne Slot.\n\nFootball in the five-subs era is now a new game of two halves: the first hour, in which the first XIs play; and the final 30 minutes plus added time when half of the outfield players change, when tactics shift and identities morph and games are won and lost. Arsenal have lost 12 points from winning positions this season, more than in any of the previous four seasons under Arteta. Right now they are unable to muscle the result away from their opponent, unable to bend the game’s narrative arc in their favour in the way Liverpool did at Brentford, and again in midweek when Diogo Jota came off the bench to sink Nottingham Forest."

      "Classify these reviews of this product. Then, give me three of the most mentioned good points and three of the most mentioned bad ones (numbered lists).\n\n\n\nI order this product regularly but the last order the grape had a foul taste. Too bad I threw away the packaging or I’d be returning. Next time I’ll be sure to check expiration date.\n---------------------------------\nI didn't know what to expect but i was pleasantly surprised at how amazing these are! First, the flavors: 10/10 I got the variety pack to try out different flavors. My favorites are raspberry and black cherry so far. They are so tasty with no sugar free aftertaste whatsoever.\nNext, the fizz: 9/10 The fizz is very mild, not overbearing. Not as fizzy as a seltzer, just a fine, enjoyable texture on the tongue.\nLastly, the energy: 10/10!! Ok, I'm an RN and this is the important part for me. Most energy drinks are too caffeinated and make me feel like jittery garbage then a crash comes later. This is honestly the best kind of energy drink I've ever tried because it gave me a rush of bright, jitter-less energy that lasted from 7a to 3pm, then i had a second one and it had the same effect, getting me through the rest of the shift. No crash, no headache, just a taper off of energy until i rebooted with the second one.\nI love this product and I'll be subscribing monthly so I never run out. So so good!!!\n-------------------------------------\nThought would try this put it in 21 oz of water the flavor is so strong and taste nothing like black cherry has funny taste not good.\nPoured half of it out and added more water still after 5 hours still have not finished the bottle. Will not buy this flavor again . Wish I could return it\n--------------------------------------\nZipfizz Healthy Energy Drink Mix in Fruit Punch flavor is a game-changer! I love that it’s sugar-free, with just 20 calories per serving, making it a guilt-free way to boost my energy. The natural sweeteners give it a pleasant taste without any artificial aftertaste, and the addition of electrolytes, vitamins, and minerals is a huge bonus. It’s the perfect pick-me-up for busy days, workouts, or when I just need a healthy boost. Highly recommend!\n-------------------------------------\nThis is our favorite flavor! This is a great quality drink...beats soda! We use the refrigerated bottled water, it dissolves easily when we shake it. The caffeine content is perfect to get through the rest of the day, or for drinking at lunch during assemblies and conventions for those long talks with soft spoken brothers. Alxo, it has B-12 and electrolytes, so I drink one mid morning at LDC and DRC projects.\n\nIt is super portable. We carry them in our cooler pocket, zip lock back in the glove box, wives wallet, and book bag. Works wonderful when we drink them at lunch for those afternoon talks at the conventions and assemblies.\n\nWe have never gotten a stomach ache...maybe that has to do with the mixture??? Hubby drinks full strength and I split it between 2 bottles of water.\n\nGreat Value!\n"

      "I need your assistance analysing the sentiment of two concert reviews for an upcoming assessment. I'll need you to find and classify appropriate sentences or phrases between the two reviews into any sentiment you see fit. Under each heading and phrase, write a brief explanation (50-100 words) as to why they've been assigned this category. After I will need to you briefly rank each musician named from 1-5 based on the overall sentiment you've assigned to them. After the classification, you will then summarise the key differences between the two reviews based off the the classifications you assigned to each in paragraph form (150-200 words), italicising any phrases you directly reference so they're easily distinguishable. At the end, I'd also like you to classify each piece mentioned in the reviews into their respective eras (classical, romantic, impressionist etc...). You can just bullet these without any added information. \n\nReview 1:\n\nNikolai Lugansky doesn’t really do charm. He certainly does heavyweight keyboard pyrotechnics, loads of them, delivered in a fierce, take-it-or-leave-it sort of way, but concepts of subtlety and delicacy don’t seem to be part of his pianistic world view. That made it all the more puzzling that he should have chosen to begin his Wigmore Hall recital with a group of six of Mendelssohn’s Songs Without Words, which are models of the intimate, modest miniature with few opportunities for anything spectacular. They were played perfectly correctly; no liberties were taken, nothing was exaggerated, but equally there was nothing to bring them alive, to give them shape or beguiling colour.\n\nIt’s the monochrome nature of Lugansky’s playing that is most troubling. However brilliantly he negotiates extreme technical challenges, and however thrillingly he hurls out torrents of notes at maximum velocity, the music always seems diminished. The dimension lacking in the Chopin group that followed the Mendelssohn – the A flat and F minor Ballades, separated by the D flat Nocturne Op 27 no 2 – was any sense of a dramatic narrative shaping the music. It goes without saying that all the virtuoso passages in the ballades were dispatched to great effect, but what came between them was far less engaging.\n\nThe second half of Lugansky’s programme was devoted to Wagner, or rather to Wagner as viewed through pianistic prisms, one of which was Lugansky himself. His own Four Scenes from Götterdämmerung mashes together episodes from the last instalment of the Ring cycle to create a continuous sequence, ricocheting from one climax to the next, but curiously undermining much of the drama in the process; Siegfried’s Funeral March loses its savagery, the music drama’s closing pages their redemptive power. There were a lot of notes, and a lot of noise, but precious little poetry, and following his own effort with Liszt’s transcription of the Tristan und Isolde Liebestod only emphasised what had been missing.\n\nReview 2:\n\nOn paper, it is an idea so obviously marketable it might have come straight from a record label boardroom: a special offer on celebrity pianists – buy one get one free! For while Yuja Wang and Víkingur Ólafsson number among classical music’s biggest names, we know them as soloists. In combination for the London stop of their duo recital tour, they predictably drew a more-than-capacity crowd, with extra seating spilling across the stage. Less predictable was whether this stellar double-act would also make musical sense.\n\nThe concert started almost inaudibly. Wang barely brushed the keys for the first notes of Berio’s Wasserklavier, its simple gestures echoing between the two Steinways, the dynamic level set at ultra-intimate. Such moments of breathtaking quiet returned periodically. Cage’s Experiences No 1 was as delicate as cut glass; Nancarrow’s Player Piano Study No 6 was driven by Ólafsson’s lopsided ostinato but made unforgettable by the sudden hush towards the end. Pärt’s Hymn to a Great City hung in the air like distant bells.\n\nSchubert’s monumental Fantasia in F minor, D940 was written for two pianists at a single instrument. Sitting separately – albeit with the pianos parked with keyboards together – makes coordination harder, but also allows more space at the keyboard itself. Wang and Ólafsson served up near-as-dammit timing and astonishingly crisp articulation, the fugato passage a masterclass in clarity and poise.\n\nIn Rachmaninov’s own original piano duo version of Symphonic Dances, Wang provided the engine from the start, all sinew and heft, while in combination their loudest chords landed like pillars dropped from a great height. Yet passages elsewhere were almost shocking in their spareness, with melodies and shapes moving seamlessly from one player to another. Moments when time almost stopped were balanced by tempi that tended to the fast and furious.\n\nBest of all, in a performance to inspire superlatives (capped by a mighty six encores), was Adams’s Hallelujah Junction. It’s a piece that barely draws breath: bright, anthemic, quicksilver. Even so their tempo was blistering. For minutes at a time, Wang’s fingers moved so quickly they blurred. Ólafsson’s bass pedal notes were thunderous. It’s hard to imagine a more viscerally thrilling performance."

I reserved it through my local library’s app this past summer, knowing that it’d arrive eventually but not particularly invested. The novel’s endless clichés, two-dimensional characters and plot, and unsophisticated writing left me questioning its popularity.\n\n“Fourth Wing” follows Violet Sorrengail as she is forced to attend Basgiath War College where she undergoes intense training and relentless trials in order to become a dragon rider. Born with chronic pain and a condition that affects her connective tissues – resulting in frequent dislocations and broken bones, Violet’s fear shifts into determination to succeed.\n\nStanding in her way is Xaden Riorson, the son of a rebellion leader, who considers Violet as his greatest enemy and supposedly wishes to kill her on sight. Old relationships begin to crumble and new ones form as Violet trains alongside both friend and foe, but everything becomes more complicated when Violet finds herself bonded to not one, but two dragons – the first human in history to do so.\n\nWhile clichés in a novel can be comforting in their predictability, Yarros’ novel is predictable when one wants intrigue, and unpredictable when one desires stability. To begin with, the plot and tropes of “Fourth Wing” are laughably transparent. Now, I know the old saying – “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” – but in the case of this novel, I’d say the clichés have a foot in the grave with how overused they are.\n\nTo sum up a few of the plot points and tropes in Yarros’ novel: a heroine that is somehow strong and weak and “not like other girls”; the male childhood friend love-interest who is turned into a villain purely for plot purposes (usually to break up a love-triangle); the heroine falls in love with the bad-boy (this must include the revelation of his tragic backstory) who is revealed to be a really great person; plot points that exist simply to exist; and sex scenes that do nothing to move the story along.\n\nForeshadowing in “Fourth Wing” lacks all subtlety. As soon as tall, dark and handsome Xaden Riorson first appeared, described so eloquently by Violet as “flaming hot. Scorching hot. Gets-you-into-trouble-and-you-like-it level of hot,” there may as well have been a flashing neon sign above his head with “LOVE INTEREST” on it.\n\nI found myself bombarded with poor attempts at foreshadowing that instead left me bored and unengaged. Perhaps Yarros underestimated the average reader’s ability to analyze, but I often found myself five steps ahead of the characters and skimming along as I waited for something more exciting.\n\nIn contrast to the predictable plot, I now need to see a chiropractor from the amount of whiplash I experienced in regard to the whirlwind characters and their motives. Even Violet, the first-person narrator of the novel, swiftly changes from one attitude to another with very little reasoning.\n\nHow is it that a novel like “Fourth Wing” has gained so much popularity? I know I enjoy casual reads, especially after all the reading required for classes, but I find myself unable to enjoy a book that assumes the reading comprehension of a fourth grader and has a writing style worse than my Lit Trad IV short story.\n\nA popular argument I’ve seen for “Fourth Wing” is that the rise in unsophisticated, easy-toread YA novels makes reading more accessible – but I would like to argue against this. Yarros’ writing style may have been easy to read, but this was because of its immaturity. Books can be accessible and still have depth, meaning and good writing. There are so many middle grade and juvenile fiction novels, like “Howl’s Moving Castle,” that require a lower-level reading comprehension but don’t sacrifice other elements of the novel in order to do so.\n\nDespite my complaints with “Fourth Wing,” it’s just one example of poorly written fiction that has shot into popularity on Booktok. It’s time for readers to redefine what makes a novel popular."
